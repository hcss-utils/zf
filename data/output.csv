INTRODUCTION
IN SEPTEMBER 2015,  Russia deployed forces to Syria, shaking the field of international relations and shuffling the cards in two interconnected conflicts—the Syrian war and the war with the Islamic State (IS). To fully understand the impact of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s bold decision—a Russian intervention unprecedented in some three decades— and to better assess both his options and those of parties affected by it, observers would benefit from looking back over the past decade-plus of Russian domestic and foreign policy developments, particularly regarding the country’s Middle East role.
On September 28, 2015, Putin addressed the UN General Assembly for the first time in ten years. The speech did not surprise. Putin covered his traditional themes, such as complaints about post– Cold War U.S. unilateralism and NATO expansion, accused the West of provoking revolutions and protests throughout the world, and suggested Washington is responsible for problems in the Middle East. He then proceeded to propose an idea he had been promoting for weeks prior to the speech: leading an anti-IS coalition in Syria.1 In those same weeks, amid lost ground by Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s forces, the Kremlin enacted a significant military buildup in Syria, intensifying its naval presence in the Mediterranean, sending additional deliveries of advanced weaponry to the Assad regime, deploying a military advance team, and delivering prefabricated housing units to an airfield near Latakia.2
Moscow had supported Assad from the very beginning of the Syrian uprising in March 2011 with weapons, advisors, loans, and political cover on the UN Security Council. Indeed, the Kremlin never hid its intentions to protect Assad diplomatically and with weapons. Yet the buildup, especially the presence of troops, suggested a qualitative change in Russia’s involvement.

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Two days after the UN speech, on September 30, the Kremlin gave the United States a one-hour warning before launching airstrikes in Syria.3 Although Moscow said it was targeting the Islamic State, numerous reports indicated most of Russia’s strikes were outside IS areas. The weaponry the Kremlin deployed in Syria, such as SA-22 (Pantsir 1) antiaircraft missiles,4 further suggested that the Islamic State was not the Kremlin’s primary target, since IS does not have an air force. Moscow’s actions indicated that it intended to protect Assad, not fight the Islamic State.
Moscow has not been forthcoming with details about its plans, thus creating possibilities for clashes and misunderstandings. The Kremlin violated Turkish airspace several times in October 2015. Of these air incursions, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said, “I will not speculate on [Russia’s] motives...but this does not look like an accident and we have seen two of them...[They] lasted for a long time.”5 Separate from the Turkish airspace incidents, Russian fighter jets twice flew in close proximity to U.S. drones; the second incident, according to a U.S. assessment, was also deliberate, as reported by CNN.6 Flaunting its newest weapons, Moscow first used in combat the Kalibr-class cruise missile on October 7, mounting a strike on Syria from warships nearly a thousand miles away from the Caspian Sea. Despite Moscow’s denials, at least four missiles crashed in Iran before reaching Syria, according to multiple press reports. On November 24, 2015, Turkey shot down a Russian Su-24, which, according to the Turkish government, briefly reentered Turkey’s territory.
Although Putin has said several times since the buildup that Russia does not plan to have boots on the ground—at least “for now”—Moscow strongly hinted, after reports of its Turkish airspace violations, that its “volunteer” ground forces will soon be fighting in Syria.7 Following such intimations, however, Putin restated in an interview with the Kremlin-run Rossiya 1 TV channel that he has no plans to send ground troops to Syria.8
Useful context here may be found in Moscow’s last Middle East intervention, dating to the Yom Kippur War of 1973, a venture that ended disastrously. When the Kremlin sent troops to Egypt to rescue the embattled Egyptian army, which faced an Israeli onslaught, Washington reacted with strength, launching a worldwide military war

alert and forcing Moscow to back down.9 This time, the U.S. response to Russia’s Syria intervention has been largely limited to statements and stationing air-to-air fighters at Turkey’s Incirlik Air Base, near the Syrian border. This response has only inflated Putin’s feeling of self-confidence.
Radical elements of the Syrian insurgency have also been strengthened by Putin’s move, with fewer actors perceiving a peaceful solution.10 In Russia itself, the gesture has invited further radicalization, while raising concerns among the country’s own Muslims, the vast majority of whom are peaceful.11 Perhaps most significant, the intervention is exacerbating the worst refugee crisis since World War II, with more Sunnis fleeing Assad’s Syria since the Russian intervention.12 These developments, in turn, strengthen Assad’s depopulation strategy—a strategy Putin understands, considering the similar policies pursued by Stalin and the Russian czars.
These recent events have sparked much interest in Russia’s involvement in Syria and the Middle East more broadly. This monograph thus provides context for Russia’s current activities in the region and explains how affairs reached this point, with a focus on Moscow’s Middle East policy since May 2000, when Putin officially came to power and chartered his country’s return to the region after a brief absence following the Cold War’s end.
Traditionally, then, Russia has been less interested in the Middle East itself than in using the region to seek possible gains against the West, or to improve its own domestic situation. Russia is no longer the same Great Power it was during the Cold War, when it maintained a substantial regional presence. Under Putin, Russia has focused primarily on political and diplomatic support to key allies, arms and energy sales, and trade. Yet the Middle East is fragile, and Russia does not need to do much to assert its influence, particularly in the context of a perceived Western retreat from the region.
Under Putin, Russia has pursued relations with virtually all Middle East countries, whether traditional allies or adversaries. The first three chapters look at Russia’s domestic context and the Kremlin’s reaction to uprisings in the post-Soviet space, the Arab Spring, and Russia itself. This context is crucial in explaining the Kremlin’s thinking on the Middle East. Whereas domestic policy generally influences a country’s
vii

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
foreign policy, the Kremlin is unique for often blurring, if not entirely eliminating, these lines.13 Such an assessment applies particularly to Putin as he has grown more anti-American and anti-Western. The remaining chapters cover Russia’s relations with four allies and major Middle East actors—Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and Syria—and include discussions of its relations with, Jordan, the GCC, Israel, and Turkey.

chapter one
PUTIN’S ASCENT
IN THE NINETEENTH century,  czarist Russia began asserting its geostrategic, economic, religious, and cultural interests in the Middle East as framed by its competition with the West. Moscow worked to build diplomatic and cultural ties, especially in Syria and Palestine, to create constituencies on which it could later rely for support. Similarly, competition with the West, primarily the United States, drove the Soviet Union during its strong almost-fifty-year Middle East presence, rooted in encouragement of regional actors pursuing an anti-Western agenda. After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the newly emergent Russia found itself focused on an entirely different set of priorities from those of its predecessor.
YELTSIN’S LEGACY When Boris Yeltsin, Russia’s first democratically elected president, assumed his first term in July 1991, Russia had fallen from the position of world superpower. The country was chaotic and weak politically, militarily, and economically. Yeltsin thus focused his attention on addressing domestic economic and political instability, a weak and disjointed government, and war with the breakaway Chechen Republic. On the foreign policy front, Russia concentrated mainly on relations with the United States, Europe, and the newly independent countries of the former Soviet Union.14
During Yeltsin’s tenure, from 1991 to 1999, Russia reduced its Middle East presence, except in Turkey and Iran.15 Personally, Yeltsin had little interest in the Middle East16 and he pursued, broadly speaking, a proAmerican, pragmatic approach to the region, driven by Russia’s domestic considerations, as opposed to the Soviet Union’s ideological approach.17 Yet domestic problems prevented the Kremlin from formulating a clear Middle East policy. Yeltsin, while ushering in a brief period of political and economic openness, was politically weak and in poor physical health.

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Rather than moving toward becoming a true democracy, Russia plunged into deep chaos: hyperinflation, corruption, war with Chechnya, a widening gap between rich and poor, and a revival of personal power politics.18 As a result, competing or conflicting interests ultimately drove Russia’s limited Middle East presence during Yeltsin’s two terms.19 Notably, from 1996 to 1998, the skilled Arabist and former Foreign Intelligence Service director Yevgeny Primakov served as foreign minister. He took a tougher, more anti-Western posture than Yeltsin’s supporters. In September 1998, toward the end of his presidency, Yeltsin appointed Primakov as prime minister in response to parliamentary pressure.20
In 2000, Yeltsin’s successor, Vladimir Putin, inherited a Russia weakened and deeply traumatized by the previous decade’s developments. Russian citizens, who had embraced democratic prospects in the early 1990s, were disillusioned and wanted stability above all else.21 This is what Putin promised to deliver, along with restoring Russia’s status as an influential global power.
THE NORTH CAUCAUSUS & DOMESTIC TERRORISM On August 9, 1999,  Boris Yeltsin resigned as Russia’s president and named his prime minister, an opaque former KGB officer named Vladimir Putin, as acting president, with elections to be held March 26, 2000. By this point, Russia had already fought one separatist war in the North Caucasus with Chechnya, from 1994 to 1996—a war marked by Moscow’s gross human rights abuses and effective transformation of Chechnya’s struggle, which originated as a secular nationalist movement, “into an Islamist one, with a jihadi component.”22
In September 1999, the month after Yeltsin named Putin as his successor, a series of apartment bombings shook the cities of Moscow, Volgodonsk, and Buynaksk, killing or injuring hundreds and spreading fear throughout the country.23 Putin quickly blamed Chechen Islamist militants for the bombings and declared a second war against Chechnya, which soon spilled over into neighboring Dagestan. Many details about these tragic events, however, including who was responsible for the bombings, remain disputed or unknown because Moscow eventually halted the investigation.24 Meanwhile, Putin officially took over as acting president on December 31, 1999.

Putin’s Ascent  
In the run-up to the March 2000 elections, Putin participated neither in debates nor election events, but his image dominated the media.25 In sharp focus during the three-month campaign were the war in Chechnya and broader instability within Russia. Putin’s campaign advanced an infamous slogan, mochit v sortire (“wipe them out in the outhouse”), in reference to terrorists. On Election Day, Putin won by a narrow margin in the first round, with 52.94 percent of the vote, but some analysts suggested that an extra 2.2 million votes, putting Putin over the top, were the product of fraud.26 At the same time, Putin’s strong stance against domestic terrorism in light of the continuing North Caucasus war had helped boost his favorability ratings, which rose from 30 percent in August 1999 to 80 percent in November 1999.27 Furthermore, Putin’s promise of stability resonated with the shaken and disillusioned Russian population.
Within his first hundred days in office, Putin instituted a “vertical integration of power,” amounting to a recentralization of presidential and federal authority, and began curtailing press freedom.28 With regard to the latter, he took small and incremental steps. Consequently, many in the West and Russia were unsure how to interpret these actions, and the West largely ignored early critics of Putin’s democratic backslide.29

chapter two
RETURN TO THE MIDDLE EAST
SHORTLY AFTER HIS FIRST presidential term began in May 2000, Putin outlined Russia’s new foreign policy, which immediately signaled a change from the Yeltsin years. Putin distanced himself from the turbulent 1990s, blaming the West for his country’s problems during that decade.
On January 10, 2000, while still interim president, Putin approved the National Security Concept of the Russian Federation, which highlighted “attempts to create an international relations structure based on domination by developed Western countries in the international community, under U.S. leadership, and designed for unilateral solutions (primarily by the use of military force) to key issues in world politics in circumvention of the foundational rules of international law.”30 The document later says, “A number of states are stepping up efforts to weaken Russia politically, economically, militarily, and in other ways” and defines NATO expansion as one among major threats “in the international sphere.”31
A MULTIVECTOR APPROACH The National Security Concept also references a “multipolar” world—corresponding to a policy originally advocated and promoted by Yevgeny Primakov in the 1990s and promoted by the Kremlin to this day—and Russia’s role as “one of the influential centres” in it. In addition, threats to Russia’s national security, according to the National Security Concept, were “manifested in attempts by other states to counteract its strengthening as one of the centers of influence in a multipolar world, to hinder realization of its national interests and to weaken its position in Europe, the Middle East, Transcaucasia, Central Asia and the Asia-Pacific Region.” This new approach also entailed demanding recognition of Russia’s legitimate privileged interests in its so-called near-abroad, loosely defined as Russkiy mir (Russian world) throughout the countries of the former Soviet Union.

Return to the Middle East  
These developments are crucial for understanding Russia’s approach to foreign policy, and specifically its approach to the Middle East. They highlight that, from the very beginning, the Kremlin under Putin viewed the West with hostility and distrust, especially given perceived Western attempts to change the status quo in any given place. In this context, the Kremlin aimed to position Russia in opposition to the West, and emphasized the importance of respect for state sovereignty. This collection of nineteenth-century Great Power concepts and rejection of an overarching legally based international system beyond the UN Security Council present, to this date, a unique challenge to the post–World War II international order. An integral part of Putin’s challenge is to deny any such order beyond what he perceives as camouflage for America’s assertions of “unique” privileged interests.
In the Middle East, Putin sought to restore Russia as a Great Power in the context of renewed zero-sum anti-Westernism. In addition to regaining political influence, he sought to raise Russia to the status of a competitor to the United States and its alleged world dominance, through putting a higher emphasis on Russia’s business interests: arms and energy (oil and gas) sales, as well as high-tech goods such as nuclear reactors.32 Indeed, the January 2000 Foreign Policy Concept defined Moscow’s priorities in the Middle East as “to restore and strengthen [Russia’s] positions, particularly economic ones,” and highlighted the importance of continuing to develop ties with Iran.33
Russia’s renewed Middle East presence entailed cooperation with both anti- and pro-American actors there. This meant support for Iran’s nuclear program, forgiveness of Syria’s almost $13 billion debt, and removal of export controls on chemical and biological technologies, alongside expanded bilateral relations with Turkey, Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.34 On this front, Moscow tied arms sales policy with its foreign policy interests. Indeed, on December 11, 2013, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said that Russia’s arms sales are the most important element of its relations with other countries.35
In sum, since his early years in office, Putin has consistently espoused the following Middle East priorities: protection of sovereignty—seen as synonymous with unity—even when it contradicted Russia’s signed obligations under entities such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and United Nations; economic gain, pri-

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
marily through arms and energy trade; and expansion of Russian influence at the expense of the West.
In December 2002, then Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov said in an interview, “It appears this is the year when we finalized a multivector policy, one in which different geographical directions and priorities supplement, rather than contradict, each other.”36 Once again countering a perceived negative picture of Russia in the West, he said, “I think the image of an either impoverished or money-spinning mafia-like Russia, an image spontaneously or sometimes purposely created in the West in the 90s, is gradually receding into the past.”37 In December 2003, Alexander Yakovenko, director of the Foreign Affairs Ministry’s Information and Press Department, wrote in the Kremlin’s official Rossiysakaya Gazeta: “Today not one significant international problem is being solved without Russia.” 38
RUSSIA AS A UNIQUE CIVILIZATION
An additional point deserves attention in understanding Russia’s approach to the Middle East. On December 30, 1999, the day before Putin officially became acting president, a document attributed to Putin appeared on the government’s website, “Russia at the Turn of the Millennium.”39 Among the document’s central points is that Russia is a country with unique values but in danger of losing its unity.40 This view, along with fear of threats to the status quo, still underlies the Kremlin’s policies in the Middle East.
Over the years, Putin has continued to stress, in speeches and remarks, this portrait of Russia as special but at risk, with the country standing in opposition to Western cultural values, described by the Kremlin as morally corrupt, while the Russian Orthodox Church has emphasized Russia’s “special” spiritual path.41 This vision also promotes a strong centralized state at the expense of individual rights, along with the belief that a Western-style democracy will not work in Russia or, for that matter, in the Middle East, justifying the claim that external democratization efforts are doomed to fail. Indeed, in the Middle East milieu, Putin presented Russia a unique civilization that straddles East and West and can therefore serve as a bridge and mediator.42
Putin also invoked Russia’s “uniqueness” to justify a democratic backslide domestically and support of authoritarian leaders abroad, including in the Middle East.43 “Under Putin,” wrote Moscow Times opinion edi-

Return to the Middle East  
tor Michael Bohm in September 2013, recognizing the Kremlin’s glaring hypocrisy, “it has become Russia’s single-handed mission to put Washington in its place by condemning its blatant double standards, violations of human rights and interventionist foreign policy.”44
In early 2000, discussing Russia’s policy in the North Caucasus, Putin explained that the fear of Russia’s collapse drove his decisions. “What’s the situation in the North Caucasus and in Chechnya today? It’s a continuation of the collapse of the USSR,” he said. “This is what I thought of the situation in August [1999], when the bandits attacked Dagestan: If we don’t put an immediate end to this, Russia will cease to exist. It was a question of preventing the collapse of the country.”45
He would later lament the Soviet Union’s breakup as one of the great geopolitical tragedies of the twentieth century, with the result that “tens of millions of our compatriots found themselves outside Russian territory...Individual savings were depreciated, and old ideals destroyed.”46 As one prominent Russian expert wrote in October 2013, “To this day, the Kremlin sometimes gives the impression of having not yet realized the fundamental differences between the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation and the impossibility of reversing history.”47 This is not to say that the Kremlin aims to restore the Soviet Union; rather, it seeks to highlight a perceived connection between Russia’s unity and stability in the Soviet days and the direct threat now posed to it by the West.
Putin has reiterated this view many times during his fifteen years in power, including at the June 2015 Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum. After the USSR collapsed, he said, the bipolar international system “went into oblivion,” propelling the United States into a state of “euphoria.” Perceiving a “vacuum that needed to be filled” in Eastern Europe, according to Putin, the United States promoted an expanded NATO presence eastward to Russia’s borders and began exploring “geopolitical spaces,” such as in the Middle East and Ukraine.48
MORE DOMESTIC TERRORISM & NATO’S LIBYA CAMPAIGN
On October 23, 2002, a group of armed Chechens seized a Moscow theater on Dubrovka Street and demanded Russian withdrawal from Chechnya and the end of the war there. They took nearly a thousand hostages, though they released some (primarily non-Russian) detainees, pregnant

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
women, and children. This event came to be known as the Nord Ost siege, named for the play being performed at the time, or the Dubrovka theater siege. Most Russians supported the militants’ demands, according to polls. Indeed, some were surprised at how moderate these demands were.49 After several days, Russian authorities stormed the building and killed all the attackers, who were themselves unconscious from the gas, but approximately 130 hostages also died in the botched rescue, primarily because doctors on hand did not know the type of gas used in the raid and therefore struggled to effectively treat the wounded. Policemen, rather than medics, carried the hostages out. The Russian government had put secrecy above all else, including the lives of Russia’s own citizens. Needless to say, the Russian government continues to avoid taking responsibility for these deaths and to claim nothing could have been done to prevent them.50 Nor has the Russian authorities’ role in the rescue, or in failing to prevent the attack in the first place, ever been investigated. Instead, reflecting Kremlin intransigence, Putin unilaterally awarded Federal Security Service deputy director Vladimir Pronichev, who managed the operation, the title “Hero of Russia.”
In December 2011, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg found that the Russian authorities had not prepared the rescue operation properly.51 In addition, the court fined the Russian government $1.6 million for violating the right to life of hostages who were killed or hurt during the botched rescue operation, in response to a January 2003 lawsuit filed by sixty-four victims and their relatives. While the court found that the Russian government had the right to use force and gas as part of the rescue operation, it faulted “the inadequate planning and conduct of the rescue operation” and “the authorities’ failure to conduct an effective investigation” into these events.52 Yet reports, at least as of late 2014, indicate that the siege’s victims had received no closure, nor admission of any wrongdoing from the Russian government.53
September 1 marks the first day of school throughout Russia, celebrated with a parade or other festivities led by children for parents, relatives, and teachers; attendance on this day is therefore significantly higher than on other school days. On September 1, 2004, armed gunmen stormed School No. 1 in Beslan, North Ossetia, then took 1,100 hostages, most of them children, and held them in the school’s gymnasium for fifty-
8

Return to the Middle East  
two hours under horrific conditions. Russian forces ultimately stormed the gym to end the ordeal, but more than 350 hostages, mostly children, died in the event—with exact numbers varying slightly depending on the report. The gunmen, by many accounts Ingush and Chechen, demanded the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya.
As with the Dubrovka Street hostage affair, many questions about this tragedy remain unanswered. Putin angrily refused to order an inquiry into Beslan’s capture and why so many innocent hostages had died. When asked about his rejection of a public inquiry, Putin equated the Beslan events to the terrorism problem faced by the United States. The same month as the attack, speaking to Western reporters and academics outside Moscow, he said, “Why don’t you meet Osama bin Laden, invite him to Brussels or to the White House and engage in talks, ask him what he wants and give it to him so he leaves you in peace?” He added, “You find it possible to set some limitations in your dealings with these bastards, so why should we talk to people who are childkillers?”54 Putin may have been likening the Russian and U.S. terrorism challenges to each other, but he was omitting a critical distinction: that the U.S. process was transparent, whereas Russia’s was opaque.
Three days after the attack, on September 4, Putin gave a speech signaling a tougher foreign policy posture:
We stopped paying the required attention to defense and security issues and we allowed corruption to undermine our judicial and law enforcement system. Furthermore, our country, formerly protected by the most powerful defense system along the length of its external frontiers[,] overnight found itself defenseless both from the east and the west...We showed ourselves [to be] weak. And the weak get beaten. Some would like to tear from us a “juicy piece of pie.” Others help them. They help, reasoning that Russia still remains one of the world’s major nuclear power[s], and as such still represents a threat to them. And so they reason that this threat should be removed. Terrorism, of course, is an instrument to achieve these aims...I am convinced that in reality we have no choice at all...What we are dealing with are not isolated acts intended to frighten us, not isolated terrorist attacks. What we are facing is direct intervention of international terror directed against Russia.55

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Putin used these events to consolidate his grip on power and further erode Russian civil society. He also assumed a tougher posture toward the West amid his existing opposition to the war in Iraq. Putin strengthened central control over Russia and over the hiring and dismissal of judges. He made sure regional governors were appointed by the president rather than elected, as they had been since 1996.56 He expanded Russia’s staterun Gazprom petroleum business and continued a repressive campaign against scholars, academics, and members of the media.57 On the last count, independent reporting on the Chechnya conflict had become virtually impossible.58 Given deteriorated relations with the West over the Iraq war, Putin increasingly turned to the Middle East (as discussed in subsequent chapters).
Although eventually the Russian government did conduct a limited investigation into Beslan, a commission composed largely of Putin supporters carried out the investigation, mostly in secret. When it finally announced its findings in December 2006, the commission largely absolved the country’s security forces of responsibility, and Putin promoted many officials involved in the siege.59 Not surprisingly, few in Russia and Beslan have been satisfied with the investigation.
A later turning point came in 2011, when Putin spoke out against NATO intervention in Libya and later accused NATO of killing Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi.60 Context here can be found in the March 17, 2011, passage by the UN Security Council of Resolution 1973, authorizing “all necessary measures” to protect civilians in Libya under UN Chapter VII “while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan territory.”61 Ten countries voted in favor of the resolution and five abstained, Russia among them. The supporters claimed protection of civilians as their “sole objective,” on the grounds that Qadhafi had intensified violence against civilians after previous punitive measures such as sanctions and an arms embargo.
“Given this intolerable provocation [of increased violence against civilians], the international community has reacted in near unanimity,” said French representative Alain Juppé during the Security Council debate on the draft resolution. The draft resolution provides NATO, he continued, “with the means to protect the civilian populations in Libya, first by establishing a no-fly zone and by authorizing the members of the Arab League and those Member States that so wish to take
10

Return to the Middle East  
the measures necessary to implement its provisions.” He added that the resolution “authorizes these same States to take all measures necessary, over and above the no-fly zone, to protect civilians and territories, including Benghazi, which are under the threat of attack by Colonel al-Qadhafi’s forces.”62
Russia’s UN ambassador, Vitaly Churkin, has said that, among Russia’s chief reasons for abstaining on Resolution 1973 was concern over the prospect of eventual military intervention.63 On March 17, the day of its signing, he explained:
...In essence, a whole range of questions raised by Russia and other members of the Council remained unanswered. Those questions were concrete and legitimate and touched on how the no-fly zone would be enforced, what the rules of engagement would be and what limits on the use of force there would be.
Furthermore, the draft was morphing before our very eyes, transcending the initial concept as stated by the League of Arab States. Provisions were introduced into the text that could potentially open the door to large-scale military intervention. During negotiations on the draft, statements were heard claiming an absence of any such intentions. We take note of these.64
Putin and then president Dmitry Medvedev clashed publicly over the resolution in a way they had not done before, with Putin strongly opposing the measure and Medvedev taking a more sympathetic view. Putin framed his stance starkly: “The resolution is defective and flawed. It allows everything...It resembles medieval calls for crusades.”65 Medvedev, thereafter, called Putin’s comment “unacceptable,”66 claiming that the resolution held no surprises. “It would be wrong for us to start flapping about now and say that we didn’t know what we were doing,” he explained at a March 21 press conference. “This [abstention] was a conscious decision on our part.” He added that he did not consider Resolution 1973 “wrong” and that, in fact, the resolution reflected Russia’s general view of the Libyan situation, but “not in everything.”67 A military intervention in Libya, he affirmed, “is something that cannot be allowed to happen.68
According to the Economist, after Medvedev’s comments, Putincontrolled Channel 1 switched overnight from portraying an aggressive West overthrowing a legitimate government under the guise of protect-
11

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
ing refugees to portraying Qadhafi as a lying villain. Later, however, the channel tried to downplay Libya coverage altogether.69 But Putin apparently would have the last word. In January 2013, after he had reassumed the presidency, a movie on Russian television, The Game of Giveaway,70 propagated the view that Medvedev had unilaterally and “in one hour” sold out Russia’s interests and betrayed Russia’s ally, allowing NATO to destroy sovereign Libya, a country “so similar to Russia,” a country that Qadhafi had transformed into a virtual paradise and with which Putin had significantly improved relations.The movie asks whether, after Iraq and Libya, countries with which the West disagreed, Russia would be next for destruction.71
Putin used such events to justify Russia’s plans to spend more than $700 billion through 2020 to modernize Russia’s armed forces, as reported by the Moscow Times. “Today’s events, including in Libya, confirmed our decisions on strengthening Russia’s defense capabilities were correct,” Putin said in March 2011.72

chapter three
LOCAL & REGIONAL INFLUENCES
ANOTHER DOMESTIC  issue that drove Russia’s renewed interest in the Middle East is its large Muslim population, coupled with a long and complex history of competition and cooperation with neighboring Muslimmajority states—a history that helped shape Russian identity.
RUSSIA’S MUSLIMS Russia is home to some 21 to 23 million Muslims,73 the largest Muslim population on the European continent.74 For a country of approximately 144 million, Muslims make up approximately 16 percent of the total population. In Moscow in particular, out of 12.5 million official residents, 1.5 million are Muslim, according to political analyst Alexey Malashenko, constituting the largest Muslim population for a Muslim-minority European city.75 Thus, Veniamin Popov, Russia’s former ambassador-at-large to Middle East organizations, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), said in May 2011 that Russia, as a global power with a large Muslim population, should be more active in the Middle East, which is “directly linked to Russia’s strategic interests.”76
With the Soviet Union’s collapse, not only the Russian Orthodox Church but also Islam experienced a revival, with a dramatic increase in mosques throughout the country. Islamic missionaries from abroad likewise began coming to Russia. Yet Russia’s overall population has been in dire decline since the early 1990s, when it dropped from 149 to 144 million, a level at which it has roughly remained. Russia continues to face high mortality, low fertility, and emigration, especially of the well-educated, given overall economic decline. Most recent Kremlin demographics data for the first half of 2015 shows little change in these trends.77 Yet against a stagnant overall population trajectory, the Muslim population is growing. Whereas, according to experts, poor health and health care, including alcoholism, constitute reasons for a fall in Christian birthrates, Muslim fami-

lies experience lower alcoholism rates, contributing to better health outcomes, even as Muslims concentrate in poorer areas. They also have more children than Christian Russians.78 According to 2014 statistics from the now-defunct Ministry of Regional Development, the North Caucasus is among Russia’s regions with the highest population growth. Dagestan is also among the top five regions for life expectancy at birth, at 75.5 years.79
Russia’s growing Muslim population has had an impact on the country’s Middle East policy and holds implications for its security. In 2006, Paul Goble, an expert on Russia’s Muslims, commented that “Russia is going through a religious transformation that will be of even greater consequence for the international community than the collapse of the Soviet Union.” 80 The vast majority of Russia’s Muslims are peaceful, hardworking citizens, many of whom face routine daily discrimination. The government, for its part, has failed to integrate Muslims into Russian society or the military—in fact, it purposely excluded most North Caucasians from the military draft even though the region presented a large pool of potential recruits. Nevertheless, in 2014, after Putin annexed Crimea, the military announced the lifting of a number of restrictions, possibly highlighting how desperate the Russian army is for soldiers.81 Even before this restriction was lifted, the number of Muslim conscripts in the Russian military had been growing. In 2013, some experts predicted that Muslims will constitute as much as half of Russia’s military conscripts within a matter of years.82
By most socioeconomic measures, Russia’s Muslims fare worse than other Russians, according to Russia expert Ilan Berman.83 Meanwhile, Russia continues to fight a losing domestic battle against radical Islam, which has intensified and spread throughout the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Kremlin’s own policies are largely responsible for this radicalization, as discussed in this paper’s sections on the Chechen conflict. From gross human rights abuses in the first Chechen war to continual reliance on unsophisticated “crushing,” rather than a more nuanced approach to radical Islam, the Kremlin has failed to curb growing radicalization.84 In addition, hundreds, if not thousands, of Chechens remain in Russian prisons to this day, where they are subjected to torture, only helping fuel radicalism.85 Russia’s intervention in Syria is likely to exacerbate this radicalization, with the Islamic State increasing recruitment of not only all Muslims but also ethnic Russians (a term

the Kremlin has used quite loosely) and Muslims from Russia. Indeed, Russian is already the third most popular IS language, after Arabic and English. The Islamic State broadcasts in Russian and publishes a Russian magazine.86
COLOR REVOLUTIONS Among the relatively local events influencing Putin’s Middle East policy was Ukraine’s pro-democracy movement, later known as the Orange Revolution. In late 2004, millions of Ukrainian citizens, wearing orange clothing, staged nationwide peaceful protests against falsified presidential elections. Nonpartisan exit polls had showed pro-Western candidate Viktor Yushchenko in the lead with 52 percent of the vote, rather than the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych—then prime minister and the choice of Ukraine’s corrupt elite—who was tallying 43 percent. Yet the official results showed Yanukovych as the winner.87 These events sparked the Orange Revolution and demonstrated the freewill, volya, and strength of Ukraine’s civil society. For Putin, this development hit too close to home. If the Ukrainians could rise up against their authoritarian ruler, what was stopping Russian citizens from doing the same? Putin thus began speaking about Western influence in the Orange Revolution, including through financing of NGOs88 and meddling in Russia’s “privileged sphere of influence.”89 Thereafter, the notion that the United States staged the color revolutions became a commonly promoted Kremlin view.
REVOLUTIONS BEYOND UKRAINE The Orange Revolution was one among a series of color revolutions throughout the post-Soviet space. It was, for example, preceded in 2003 by a revolution in Georgia and followed in 2005 by one in Kyrgyzstan.90 The year 2005 also saw Lebanon’s Cedar Revolution and Iraq’s so-called Purple Revolution, which the Kremlin viewed in much the same vein. Indeed, the Cedar Revolution modeled itself after the revolutions in Ukraine and Georgia.91 Yet Ukraine in particular, given its complicated history with Russia, mattered far more than any other postSoviet country.
For Putin and many top Russian officials, events in Ukraine continued to echo events in the Middle East and a perceived unilateral U.S.

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
interventionism. In his September 11, 2013, New York Times op-ed, Putin wrote, “It is alarming that military intervention in internal conflicts in foreign countries has become commonplace for the United States...But force has proved ineffective and pointless. Afghanistan is reeling...Libya is divided into tribes and clans. In Iraq the civil war continues.”92 The next year he connected the color revolutions, Western intervention, and events in the Middle East.93
Approximately a decade after the Orange Revolution, on April 1, 2014, Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu argued at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Khujand, Tajikistan, that “a scenario similar to the Arab Spring was used” to oust former president Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine.94 The Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the Kremlin’s official newspaper, tied together “mechanisms of foreign interference” and “models of provocation” in Russia, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Syria.95
To give another example, speaking at a Security Council meeting in November 2014, which reviewed state attempts to counter extremism, Putin equated the color revolutions with “extremism.” He said, “We see to what tragic consequences led the wave of the so-called color revolutions, and we will do everything to ensure that this never happens in Russia.” He went on to express the view that the “extremism” of color revolutions was being used as a geopolitical instrument to reshape spheres of influence.96
Similarly, in April 2015, Putin made the following assertion before senior Kremlin officials: “We are against interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states, provocation of armed conflict. Such a practice toward a number of countries in North Africa and the Middle East has led to rampant terrorism there, and close to our borders has created a bloody drama for our neighbors in Ukraine.”97
PUTIN AND THE ARAB SPRING By 2010, just as Russia had succeeded in restoring some of its Middle East influence—including “good relations with every government and most major opposition movements,” according to George Mason University professor Mark Katz98—widespread uprisings swept the region. These events affected Putin roughly as Ukraine’s Orange Revolution had, on the one hand instilling fear that Russian citizens could be inspired to
16

Local and Regional Influences  
oust their own strongman, and on the other fueling a belief that the West had orchestrated the events to reduce Russia’s regional influence through eliminating its traditional allies.99
Western analysts recognized both the Arab Spring protests’ aspiration for freedom and democracy and their grievances arising from lack of accountability and economic stagnation. But these analysts also acknowledged the violent forces these movements unleashed, and debated the implications of backing corrupt and stagnant authoritarian rulers against possibly violent, extremist, or chaotic opposition. Meanwhile, the Kremlin-funded propaganda machine portrayed these events in a generally negative light and quickly began broadcasting messages on the dangers of “regime change” and the “chaos” that the Arab Spring brought to the Middle East through Western intervention. Indeed, one Russian analyst wrote:
Strictly speaking, the Arab Spring was not the first wave of revolution to sweep the world in the 21st century. It was preceded by a chain of events, more spread-out over time, that mainly took place in the post-Soviet space and were labelled the “color revolutions.” This term is understood to mean a series of non-violent coups... Let us simply say that their common denominator is the illegal (but legitimized with Western support) replacement of unpopular leaders with regimes that declared the goals of moving towards the European Union as an alternative to cooperation with Russia. At the same time, a commitment was declared to build liberal democratic states on the Western model.100
To give another example, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said in October 2012, “The Arab Spring was the harvest of seeds sown by [George W.] Bush Jr., with the concept of the ‘Greater Middle East’ and democratization of that entire space.”101 And in December 2013, Mikhail Margelov, then chairman of Russia’s Foreign Affairs Committee and a key liaison with African countries, said, “Russia believed that the situation in each country of the region had to be resolved through political means, avoiding violence and civil war. That stance was prompted by the history of attempts to impose democracy on Islamic countries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, through intervention. The efforts ended in failed states rather than democracy.”102
17

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Beyond direct statements, the Kremlin has sought to control public perceptions of the Arab Spring on a more subtle level. The Kremlinfunded RIA Novosti has a page dedicated to Arab Spring–related news, titled Arabskiy Perevorot,103 meaning “Arab coup,” with the latter term usually carrying a negative connotation—possibly translated as “upheaval,” given that it literally means “upside down.” In the same vein, the Kremlin-controlled media typically refers to Crimea’s “return” to Russia, rather than Russia’s annexation of Crimea, to reinforce the idea that Crimea has always been part of Russia and belongs there.
Arguably, the Kremlin’s portrayal of the Arab Spring has resonated well within segments of Russian society. According to Fyodor Lukyanov, who edits the influential journal Russia in Foreign Affairs,
Today’s Russian society does not believe in revolutions after its multitude of shocks, dashed hopes, and disappointments. The value of stability is appreciated, for the time being, both by those at the top and at the bottom. An ordinary Russian observer looks at the euphoria of excited crowds with extreme skepticism, knowing how such usually ends...No grounds for optimism are to be found in the outcome of the tumult in the countries of the so-called Arab Spring—not in a single one.104
On March 18, 2014, speaking before Russia’s Federal Assembly about the situation in Crimea, Putin again tied events in Ukraine with the Middle East. The gist of his remarks was that the West, led by the United States, was continuing a long-running campaign of force against sovereign nations, from the 1999 NATO bombing of the former Yugoslavia, to the post-Soviet color revolutions, to “coups” in the Middle East. The legitimate grievances of people tired of “life without prospects...were cynically used,” he said, and onto these countries standards “were forced” that did not fit their traditions and history. As a result, Putin said, instead of democracy and freedom came “chaos, sparks of violence, a series of coups—the Arab Spring has turned into an Arab Winter.”105
In addition to spreading the message that the West fomented the Arab Spring uprisings, the Kremlin has tagged the West with responsibility for creating the Islamic State. Thus, prominent Russian historian and Middle East expert Georgiy Mirsky wrote in his blog on the liberal
18

Local and Regional Influences  
radio station Echo Moskvy’s website, “In particular, it is hammered every day into the [Russian] population that Americans created ISIS and stand behind the jihadists, who simply sometimes get out of control.”106
In addition to lost political influence in light of the Arab Spring, the Kremlin was concerned with the financial losses entailed by the ouster of the Kremlin’s traditional Soviet-era allies. Indeed, Putin wrote in a February 2012 article for Russia’s annual Valdai Conference website, “It appears that with the Arab Spring countries, as with Iraq, Russian companies are losing their decades-long positions in local commercial markets and are being deprived of large commercial contracts.”107
Libya and Syria in particular have been two of Russia’s biggest arms customers. In Libya, Russia lost billions of dollars’ worth of arms contracts. While the Russian government and analysts typically quantified this loss at $4 to $4.5 billion, “the real lost revenue,” according to Mikhail Dmitriyev, who heads Russia’s Federal Service on Military and Technical Cooperation, “could top tens of billions of dollars.”108 Lost contracts covered a wide range of military equipment, including Su-35 fighters, Yak130 combat and training planes, Project 636 submarines, advanced S-300 systems, Mi-17 transport helicopters, and many others. In Syria, Russia stood to lose approximately $20 billion should Bashar al-Assad fall.109
Having created an important context, we now turn to Russia’s influence in certain individual Middle East countries.

EGYPT
RUSSIA-EGYPT RELATIONS have a long history, particularly those between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Church of Alexandria. Diplomatically, during much of the Cold War, Egypt was among the Soviet Union’s closest and most important Middle East allies. Although relations deteriorated after Egyptian president Anwar Sadat expelled Soviet military advisors and air force personnel from the country in summer 1972, they began improving after the Soviet Union’s fall, and especially after Putin came to power.
On August 14, 2000, five months after his election as Russia’s president, Putin and Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak spoke by phone in what was their first “direct contact,” according to the Kremlin, discussing “issues of friendly relations.”110 In April 2001, Mubarak came to Moscow and signed a “long-term programme of developing trade, economic, industrial, science, and technical cooperation” and a “declaration of principles of friendly relations and cooperation.”111 Other high-level official exchange visits followed in the coming years.
In September 2004, in Cairo, Sergei Lavrov signed the “Protocol on Strategic Cooperation and Dialogue between Foreign Ministries.” On April 26–27, 2005, Putin visited Egypt—the first such visit in forty years—and signed another statement on “deepening friendly relations,” which underlined the increasingly “strategic character” of Egypt-Russia ties. That same month, Putin visited the Council of the Arab League—the first-ever visit by a Soviet or Russian leader—and the Council accredited the Russian ambassador in Egypt as a plenipotentiary representative to the Arab League. Other high-level official exchanges over the years included additional visits from heads of state, and the two countries signed documents signaling increased bilateral cooperation on education, science, and energy—including a March 8 agreement on Russia’s involvement in Egypt’s nuclear power industry— and trade.112
20

Egypt  
With the onset of the Arab Spring and Mubarak’s ouster, Russia temporarily lost influence in Egypt. Putin was eager to regain it and reached out to the Muslim Brotherhood, even though Russia’s Supreme Court had labeled the group a terrorist organization in February 2003 and officially banned it in Russia’s territory.113 Russian officials had also repeatedly accused the Muslim Brotherhood of strengthening the Islamic insurgency in the North Caucasus. Nonetheless, on June 28, 2012, Putin congratulated newly elected president and Muslim Brotherhood member Mohamed Morsi on his victory.114 The next month, on July 23, Putin sent a telegram congratulating Morsi on the sixtieth anniversary of the country’s 1952 revolution—a nationalist upheaval that ended British occupation. Putin expressed the “desire to strengthen relations” between Russia and Egypt in “all different areas,” as well as for “constructive partnership” between the two countries to resolve regional issues.115
Putin thus signaled that he welcomed the return of Egypt as leader of the Arab world. Yet a subtle anti-Western message dwelled in this outreach: Putin had chosen to congratulate Morsi on the anniversary of an event viewed by many as the overthrow of Western imperialism. Russian officials also began discussing the possibility of easing restrictions on the Muslim Brotherhood in Russia,116 and in April 2013 Morsi visited Moscow, a gesture described by the Kremlin’s official newspaper as “opening doors for cooperation” between the two countries.117
Putin’s outreach to the Muslim Brotherhood revealed that although Putin might prefer secularists in Egypt, he would work with the Islamists to secure Russia’s influence amid the vacuum created by the Western absence, even if this meant supporting an organization that in the Kremlin’s own view encouraged terrorism and instability in Russia.118
After Morsi’s ouster in July 2013, Egypt-Russia relations began improving notably just as U.S.-Egypt relations began to decline. Cairo was growing increasingly concerned with what it perceived to be U.S. engagement with the Muslim Brotherhood, and felt abandoned in its fight against terrorists, particularly in the Sinai Peninsula—a hotbed of radicalism and instability going back to Mubarak’s time. Washington also delayed weapons deliveries to Egypt, withheld military aid, and later halted the nascent U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue. The decline of
21

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
U.S.-Egypt relations thus created an opportunity for Putin to assert his national interests in Egypt.
Unlike President Barack Obama, Putin enthusiastically endorsed Abdul Fattah al-Sisi’s bid for the Egyptian presidency. Putin had no interest in criticizing Sisi on his democratic backslide. In the view of some experts, the Kremlin was looking to boost ties with Egypt to ensure the success of the upcoming Geneva peace conference on Syria, while others thought the Kremlin saw in Sisi a new Gamal Abdul Nasser, who spoke out for Arab nationalism and against Western imperialism.119
Economic relations between Egypt and Russia have improved significantly in recent years. In 2014, out of 10 million Russian tourists traveling abroad, more than 3 million have visited Egypt, primarily the Sinai resort of Sharm al-Sheikh. According to Putin, this represented an approximately 50 percent increase as compared to the previous year.120
On October 31, 2015, however, the Russian passenger Metrojet Airbus A321 crashed as it took off from Sharm al-Sheikh, killing all 224 passengers. While the Russian government was slow to admit the crash was the result of a terrorist-planted bomb, and in fact claimed the U.S. and British governments had “irresponsibly” rushed to conclusions,121 by November 6 Putin had suspended all flights to Egypt.122 Prime Minister Medvedev soon reportedly said that the Russian government had evacuated approximately 25,000 out of 80,000 Russian tourists from Egypt.123 The suspension of flights will undoubtedly hurt the Egyptian economy, and in late December the Egyptian government expressed the hope that it would soon be lifted.124 At the time of this writing, though, the Russian government has expressed no such intentions.
Trade between the two countries also grew by approximately 50 percent over this period, according to Putin, reaching more than $4.5 billion in 2014. Specifically, Russia provides approximately 40 percent of Egypt’s grain. In July 2015, Russia and Egypt held their first-ever joint naval exercises, off the Port of Alexandria.125 Indeed, Putin has made Russian naval expansion a priority, including restoring Russia’s naval presence on the Mediterranean, and an alliance with Egypt is helping him achieve this goal.126
22

Egypt  
Ultimately, the curtailed U.S. engagement with Egypt failed to elicit the human rights advances sought by Washington. It also hurt Egypt’s crucial military efforts against its own jihadists. Putin exploited this vacuum and has gained credibility, as well as financial and strategic benefits, as a result.

chapter five
IRAN
RUSSIA AND IRAN share a complicated history. For centuries, RussiaIran relations vacillated between limited cooperation, competition, and outright conflict. Toward the end of the Cold War, the Soviet Union began selling arms to Iran. Between 1989 and 1991, the Soviets signed a number of arms-supply deals with Tehran, worth a total of $5.1 billion, making Iran one of the Soviet defense industry’s biggest clients. In the 1990s, Moscow and Tehran entered a period of strategic cooperation based on mutual interests. Moscow continued to rely primarily on its own weapons industry for economic growth; Iran was interested in benefiting from this policy. Throughout the 1990s, Russia’s defense industry continued to supply weaponry to Iran, such as tanks and ammunition. Russia also helped Iran build factories that produced tanks and armored personnel carriers. In addition, oil prices rose in the late 1990s, and the Kremlin began to view Iran as a more attractive recipient of Russian exports than it had previously.
Another significant factor driving cooperation with Iran in the 1990s involved Russia’s insecurities about Central Asia and the Caucasus. Moscow believed Tehran was interested in expanding into these regions, and Moscow was unsure what impact increased Iranian influence would have on Russia’s sizable Muslim minorities. In 1999, shortly before Putin assumed his first presidential term, Moscow’s insecurity about the nation’s direction contributed, in part, to the Kremlin’s desire to establish clearly defined spheres of influence.127 According to the scholar Talal Nizameddin, who authored a recent book on Russia in the Middle East under Putin, “During the 1990s Moscow shifted towards a more geo-strategic Eurasian emphasis and increasingly Iran would become a defense shield in Russia’s southern region.”128 Indeed, this consideration continues to influence Russia’s Iran policy.129
In October 2000, Moscow increased its efforts to complete the Iranian nuclear reactor in Bushehr, a project Russia had become involved
24

Iran  
in a few years earlier but that had been started by Germany’s Siemens and abandoned after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Though Putin at this stage was cautious in his relations with the United States, in November 2000 he unilaterally revoked the Gore-Chernomyrdin protocol130—a secret U.S.-Russia agreement signed by then Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and U.S. vice president Al Gore in June 1995, which required Russia to end all military cooperation with Iran by 1999 in exchange for cooperation with the United States on defense technology.131
Now that Putin was president, many hardline Russian politicians and generals endorsed improving relations with Iran in anticipation of major arms sales. By 2001, Iran grew to become the third largest buyer of Russian weaponry.132 That year, Iran also purchased from Russia “thirty military transport planes and thirty Mi-8 military transport helicopters.”133 The increased arms trade raised Russia-Iran relations and cooperation to a new level. Upon Putin’s invitation, Iranian president Mohammad Khatami came to Moscow in March 2001—the first such visit by an Iranian president since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Throughout the coming years, Russia and Iran maintained nuclearmaterials trade and the Kremlin shielded Tehran from Western pressure and defended its nuclear program as peaceful, even in the face of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, Tehran looked the other way on Russia’s actions in Chechnya. Still, historical distrust between the two countries remained, and Russia and Iran did not always act in each other’s best interest. Illustrating such divergence was a July 2001 incident in which Tehran halted BP’s oil exploration efforts off Azerbaijan’s Caspian coast, in an area Tehran also claimed. As a result, Azerbaijan turned to the United States and Turkey for support, indirectly undermining Russia’s interests.134
The 2003 Iraq war gave Russia and Iran another reason for increased cooperation: a shared sense of perceived Western encroachment and aversion to the spread of liberal democracy. In the Iraq context, both also feared the rise of Sunni radical extremism, including in Afghanistan— which is traditionally anti-Shiite and anti-Russian.
In December 2005, Tehran signed a billion-dollar arms deal that included twenty-nine Tor-M1 missile-defense systems to protect the
25

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Bushehr nuclear power plant. According to press reports in early 2006, Russia had also invested $750 million in energy projects in Iran.135 The same year, Moscow strongly endorsed the P5+1 format for negotiating with Tehran on the nuclear issue because of its multilateral approach. This new format gave Russia increased diplomatic leverage over the West, and Russia consistently diluted sanctions against Tehran.
On nuclear proliferation generally, Russia’s attitude differs from that of the West. Moscow primarily cares about its own interests and whether or not a country’s nuclear program would threaten these interests, rather than international security. In 2002, Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov outlined Moscow’s policy toward nuclear proliferation: “The key criteria of Russian policy in this sphere are our own national security, the strengthening of our country’s international positions and the preservation of its great power status.”136 Moscow does not want another nuclear rival in the region, but sees such a prospect as less threatening than does the West.137 For example, Russia’s 2015 military doctrine and its earlier 2010 iteration cast NATO as a greater threat to Russia than Iran’s nuclear proliferation. Russia’s National Security Strategy, most recently updated December 31, 2015, not only names NATO expansion and the color revolutions among top threats to Russia’s security but also asserts that NATO’s latest buildup on Russia’s border violates international law.138 Geographically, Russia is closer than Western nations to other nuclear powers, and the Kremlin is used to dealing with these nations and therefore less threatened. Putin has thus often downplayed Iran’s nuclear ambitions. In June 2013, for example, he said: “I have no doubt that Iran is adhering to the rules. Because I have no proof of the opposite.”139 From Moscow’s perspective, according to Mark Katz, a nuclear agreement that improved Iran’s relations with the United States would be worse for Moscow than a nuclear Iran.140
In October 2007, visiting Tehran for a summit including Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan, Putin warned, “We should not even think of making use of force in this region.” This was the first visit to Tehran by a Kremlin head of state since Stalin’s 1943 visit.141 That December, Russia began delivering nuclear fuel for Bushehr, asserting it would be used for peaceful purposes. President George W. Bush framed the situation this way:
26

Iran  
One of the interesting tactical decisions that Russia has made—that the United States supports—is the notion that Iran has a sovereign right to have a civilian nuclear power program. What they don’t have is our confidence that they should be able to enrich uranium so that those plants would work. Why? Because they had a covert weapons program that they did not declare and have yet to declare.142
During his second term, Putin used Russia’s association with Tehran as a bargaining chip in his resistance to a missile-defense shield in Eastern Europe oriented toward Iran, Russia’s conflict with Georgia, and other points of disagreement with the West, as well as to maintain Russia’s increased influence in the Middle East. Moscow’s actions show that its interests in Tehran were strictly pragmatic and calculated based on realpolitik. Working with Iran fit the Kremlin’s broader strategy. “An opinion became prevalent in Moscow,” writes Talal Nizameddin, “that persistent U.S. threats to launch a military campaign against Iran belied a greater ambition by Washington and its allies to weaken and isolate Russia.”143 Furthermore, according to Mark Katz, the Iran sanctions as approved by Moscow increased the demand for Russian oil. They made Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan reliant on export routes through Russia while blocking the construction of pipelines in Iran.144 Azerbaijan and, to a lesser extent, Kazakhstan export through the Caucasus and Turkey. Turkmenistan, for its part, has a large gas pipeline to China. Thus, for the Kremlin, the advantages of supporting Iran outweighed the disadvantages. From Tehran’s perspective, Russia was a similarly useful partner as Iran expanded its ties in the region.
Although the Kremlin agreed to support Western sanctions against Iran in 2010, it convinced the UN to water them down, and also extracted an unprecedented concession: the lifting of U.S. sanctions against the Russian military complex, which would technically allow Moscow to sell antiaircraft batteries to Tehran.145 As recalled by Ambassador Eric Edelman, a former assistant to Vice President Dick Cheney, the Russians first appeared to share Western goals during the talks, but then they would quickly turn around and act as Iran’s lawyer.146
The same year, under Israeli and U.S. pressure, Russia agreed to suspend, but not cancel, an $800 million contract from 2007 with Iran for S-300 antiaircraft missiles—a system that could help shoot down U.S. or Israeli warplanes in the event of a strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities—in
27

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
exchange for concessions on missile defense in Europe. In October 2011, shortly after anti-Assad protests broke out in Syria, a Hezbollah delegation paid its first official visit to Moscow.147 While few details about the visit were made public, its reported purpose was to discuss regional developments, such as Moscow’s views on the Arab Spring and support for Assad.148 The visiting delegation’s head, Mohammad Raad, said that “this first visit paved the way for cooperation and follow-up discussions with the Russian officials.”149
Tehran supported Putin’s decision to return to the presidency for a third term in May 2012. Mahmoud Reza Sajjadi, Iran’s ambassador to Russia, explained, “There is almost no other state such as Russia, which has so many common interests and common views with Iran.” Iranian sources such as the hardline daily Resalat noted the hope Tehran placed in Putin’s ability to resist the West and the proposed U.S. reset. Nikolai Bobkin, chief editor of the Russian magazine Delovoy Iran (Business Iran), described the “unusual for official circles candor” with which Iranian diplomats talk about Russia as its closest ally.150
As already suggested, Russia has never been as threatened by Iran’s nuclear program as the West has been. In January 2012, the Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement declaring Western concerns to be overblown. While expressing “regret” and “concern” about the launch of the new Iranian uranium enrichment plant at Fordow, near Qom, the statement noted that “Iran informed the IAEA of the beginning of the enrichment work at this facility beforehand and that all nuclear material there is under the agency’s control.”151 While this was technically correct, the IAEA also confirmed that Iran had begun production of uranium enriched at up to 20 percent, which according to analysts was a step toward building a nuclear weapon. Indeed, Western officials quickly condemned the move as a sign of escalation and a violation of Iran’s nuclear obligations.152 Lavrov, meanwhile, has also argued that Iran deserves to be an “equal partner” in resolving Middle East issues, and that sanctions hurt Russia-Iran trade.
In particular, the recent closeness of Iran-Russia government ties has been unprecedented. On the nuclear front, the state-run Russian firm Atomstroy helped the Iranians complete the Bushehr nuclear power plant, officially giving the Iranians control of the facility in September 2013. And in November 2014, Russia’s state-run nuclear corporation
28

Iran  
Rosatom announced an agreement to build two new reactor units in Iran, possibly to be followed by six more.
In light of Putin’s standoff with the West over Russian aggression in Ukraine, bilateral cooperation has intensified and expanded to other sectors. In August 2014, for example, the Russian Ministry of Energy announced an oil-for-goods deal with Iran worth $1.5 billion per month; under the proposed terms, approximately 500,000 barrels of Iranian oil per day would be provided at a discount in exchange for Russian goods and services. Analysts questioned the accord’s logistical feasibility, and its current status is unclear, but the agreement remains on the table.
Similarly, in December 2015, Mehdi Sanaei, Iran’s ambassador to Russia, reportedly announced the obviously unrealistic goal of boosting bilateral trade from the current $3–5 billion to $70 billion. Previously, in a June 2014 interview with Russia in Global Affairs, he had offered advice on how to minimize the effects of Western sanctions and praised Moscow’s prominent international role in the matter.
Meanwhile, Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has met with Putin six times in the past year,153 and other senior officials from both countries have held multiple meetings as well. Most recently, Putin visited Iran on November 23, 2015, and met with Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,154 who thanked Putin for his role in the nuclear negotiations, reportedly describing the Russian leader as “one of the most influential people in the world.”155 Upon the meeting’s conclusion, Putin and Rouhani announced a package of signed agreements, including on trade and easing travel for citizens of both countries. In addition, they announced contracts on construction in Iran of the Garmsar–Incheh Borun railway electrification project, a thermal power plant, and a desalination plant, and an agreement on deep-groundwater reserves in Iran.156 Putin added that the two countries will continue to cooperate on nuclear energy.
In January 2015, Russian defense minister Shoigu traveled to Tehran, the first such visit by a Russian defense minister in fifteen years. He and his Iranian counterpart, Hossein Dehghan, signed a memorandum of understanding on military cooperation, and while the details remain sparse, the document apparently mentioned joint military drills. The next month, Putin lifted the ban on the S-300 sales after Tehran signed an interim nuclear agreement with the West, and press reports indicated that Russia plans to deliver them by the end of 2015. 157 The Russian press
29

later reported that according to a December 30, 2015, interview with Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin, Russia began delivering S-300s to Iran.158 The Kremlin was especially supportive of the completed Iran deal, and Putin even took credit for its approach.159 For Putin, the deal meant that “bilateral relations with Iran will receive a new impetus and will no longer be influenced by external factors.”160
For all their lofty pronouncements of friendship and cooperation, both Tehran and Moscow ultimately see each other as part of a larger strategic calculus, and hence do not fully trust each other. Analysts argue that Tehran had not forgotten the snub of the S-300 weapons ban and felt similarly disrespected by the Gore-Chernomyrdin protocol. Tehran, of course, would have preferred that Moscow oppose sanctions against it altogether. Ultimately, interests driving Russia’s Iran policy include reducing the West’s influence and raising its own, and possibly fostering a better relationship with Tehran, even at the expense of international security.
Thus in April 2015, Georgiy Mirsky wrote in his blog, “Several years ago, I heard from the lips of one MIA [Ministry of Internal Affairs] employee such reasoning: ‘For us, a pro-American Iran is worse than a nuclear Iran.’” This statement, according to Mirsky, demonstrates that “it doesn’t matter what will happen with Iran and in general with the Middle East—the main thing is that Washington wins nothing.”161 Although Russia’s and Iran’s long-term goals in Syria may differ,162 in the short term a clear Russia-Iran alliance has emerged. Most recently, in the context of Russia’s Syria intervention, Russian officials announced plans to open a $5 billion credit line to Iran. 163

IRAQ
RUSSIA’S RELATIONS  with Iraq go back decades and have been complicated, characterized by periods of cooperation and disagreement alike. Upon entering office in 2000, Putin set out to expand Russia’s influence in Iraq. He aimed to support development of major Russian business ties, especially through Russian oil companies, and thereby secure political influence. In doing so, he sought to recover the approximately $8 billion debt Iraq owed Russia, primarily accumulated when Saddam Hussein purchased Soviet weaponry in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq War. The commercial component was especially important because Russia’s contracts with Iraq were worth more than Russia’s contracts with any other Arab states.164
During Putin’s first presidential term, the Kremlin renewed a push to remove UN sanctions against Iraq.165 During Hussein’s rule, according to expert estimates, Russian companies could make as much as $70 billion on oil concessions, primarily from the massive West Qurna II field.166 The maintenance of UN sanctions was therefore contrary to Russian business interests.167 In particular, the UN-approved oil-for-food program had been highly profitable for Russian companies, granting Iraqi oil to Russia in return for various products, from rice to refinery equipment, on preferential terms. More than a third of Russia’s tax revenues depended on oil prices, and Hussein’s eventual ouster entailed a loss of lucrative contracts, especially given the rise in oil prices.168
At this stage, U.S.-Russia relations were relatively strong. Indeed, the United States hinted that Russia would be able to restore its interests in Iraq after the war. For example, in a live 2003 interview with Echo Moskvy, U.S. secretary of state Colin Powell expressed confidence that a new Iraqi government would repay Iraq’s $8 billion debt to Russia in full, and that the United States would not object to the presence of Russian peacekeepers in Iraq. He also confirmed Washington’s intention to

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
repeal the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a measure initially intended to grant normal trade relations to communist countries in exchange for improving their human rights record, especially on emigration. Indeed, Russia had viewed the amendment as an irritant to bilateral ties since the Soviet Union’s fall.169 Other signs, however, suggested a fraying. By March 2003, Putin had publicly supported France’s opposition to the war, calling it “a direct violation of international law, and a major political mistake.”170
In addition, allegations arose that Russia had moved Hussein’s weapons into Syria in the weeks before the U.S. invasion. Particularly, John A. Shaw, a deputy undersecretary of defense, claimed that Russian troops, working with Iraqi intelligence, “almost certainly” removed the highexplosive material that went missing from the al-Qaaqaa weapons facility, south of Baghdad.171
Writing about Russia’s stance on the Iraq war, Yevgeny Primakov explains, “Our position was that a war in Iraq would further divide the world along religious lines, destabilize many of the Middle East’s more moderate regimes, and weaken the international support enjoyed by the United States after September 11.” He goes on, “Russia did everything in its power to stop the invasion of Iraq,” recalling that Putin sent him to Baghdad in February 2003, where he unsuccessfully urged Hussein to resign.172
In the end, the Kremlin abandoned Hussein when it became clear that war was imminent. This shift can be explained in part by Russia’s own frustration with Hussein’s years of erratic behavior. In addition, Hussein’s international image was far too poor for Russia to support him in a military confrontation against the United States.173
Yet ultimately, the Kremlin valued its interests in Iraq above all else. Indeed, Putin tried to maintain good ties with all players—the United States, Hussein, and the Iraqi opposition—to ensure access to Iraqi oil no matter who emerged victorious. At the same time, pronouncements of opposition to the war scored Putin domestic points in the run-up to the 2004 election, in which he sought to maintain his image as a strong nationalist in light of the Beslan attack. This opposition also gained him credibility in the Middle East among anti-American actors, such as Syria and Iran, for standing up to perceived U.S. unilateralism, all the while fitting Putin’s vision of a “multipolar” world.
32

Iraq  
In December 2003, Putin told a visiting Iraqi delegation that Russia was ready to forgive more than half of the $8 billion owed by Baghdad. “We strongly hope that Russia will have good relations with the new leadership of Iraq,” Putin said. Abdulaziz al-Hakim, head of the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Governing Council, reportedly said Putin made this “generous promise” in return for granting Russian companies access to opportunities in Iraq. Russian officials reportedly suggested that the amount written off by Moscow would be closely linked to the access given to Russian companies, especially oil companies.174
After the war, the Kremlin focused on regaining lost and unimplemented contracts in Iraq and achieved some success in recouping influence. This became all the more important because oil prices almost doubled in 2004 as compared to 2003—from $30 at the end of 2003 to $56.37 at their peak in October 2004.175 Furthermore, the weakened U.S. regional position and the rise of the Iraqi insurgency created an opportunity for Putin to step in.
In 2005, the Kremlin agreed to write off much of Iraq’s Sovietera debt, and Russia’s Lukoil provided several million dollars’ worth of humanitarian aid to Iraq.176 In February 2008, Russia forgave all Iraq’s $12.9 billion in debt.177
Since 2009, Lukoil and Gazprom Neft (a Gazprom subsidiary) have won a number of large contracts.178 One analyst concluded in June 2011 that Russia’s “further involvement in Iraq will generally be well received by the Arabs, who have traditionally viewed Moscow as a counterweight to the U.S.”179 Indeed, in 2012 the Kremlin signed a $4 billion arms deal with the Iraqi government—the largest single arms deal of Putin’s tenure. The accord placed Iraq as the second largest buyer of Russian arms after India and equal to China, according to a July 2012 report by Russia’s giant state-run technology and defense industry corporation Rostec.180 This accord also places Russia as the second largest supplier of arms to Iraq after the United States.181 According to Russian press reports, deliveries began in October 2013,182 after a delay reportedly caused by internal corruption claims in the Iraqi parliament.
In October 2013, Putin identified Iraq as an important Middle East partner and announced Russia’s readiness, in this context, to help Iraq, including through “military-technical” cooperation.183 In an April 2015 interview with Iraq Oil Report, Andrei Kuzyaev, head of Lukoil’s non-

Russian operations, said the company plans to make West Qurna II one of Iraq’s largest producers in a year.184
OUTREACH TO KURDISTAN Moscow has reached out not only to Baghdad but also to Iraqi Kurdistan, showing once again the Kremlin’s determination to work with everyone, even if such a move risked angering and losing contracts with Baghdad. Lukoil, for instance, has played a major role as an energy exporter in Iraqi Kurdistan. And in 2012, Gazprom Neft signed two deals with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), making it the fourth major oil company to enter the region and putting it in the same league as U.S.-based Chevron and ExxonMobil and France-based Total. In February 2013, KRG president Masoud Barzani, whose father, Mustafa Barzani, spent approximately twelve years in exile in the Soviet Union, made an official visit to Moscow to strengthen KRG-Russia ties—the first such visit by the Kurdistan president. Upon its conclusion, Gazprom Neft signed an agreement to enter a Kurdistan oil project, the Halabja block—the third Russian energy project in Kurdistan to date.185 Baghdad, for its part, tolerates such behavior because of its desire for Russian arms.
CRITICISM OF IRAQ WAR Since 2003, the Russian government has consistently decried Western intervention in Iraq, especially as sectarian violence escalated after the U.S. troop withdrawal in late 2011 and the Syrian war helped fuel another Iraqi insurgency. According to Russian foreign minister Lavrov, speaking in June 2014 as violence surged, “What is happening in Iraq is an illustration of the complete failure of the adventure, which was started primarily by the United States and Britain and which they let get out of control completely.”186 In the words of Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich, speaking during the same month, “It is necessary to draw proper conclusions about how dangerous and unacceptable it is to flirt with extremists of all stripes, be guided by double standards, and intervene, including by force, in the internal affairs of sovereign states.”187 In June 2015, at the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin himself asserted that the United States had destroyed Iraq, a country that had previously lacked an al-Qaeda presence, by creating a power vacuum soon filled by the Islamic State.188
34

Iraq  
Nonetheless, instability in Iraq has generally helped Russia in various ways, such as by keeping oil prices high and increasing demand for Russian oil. In 2002, for example, “Russia had risen to the first place among Iraq’s main trading partners, leaving behind Egypt and France.”189
From a geostrategic perspective, U.S. success in Iraq was not in Putin’s interest, given the influence this would entail over the greater Middle East. Even in the early 2000s, the Kremlin perceived NATO’s overall expansion as an encroachment on its sphere of influence. The Caucasus remained unstable, China was gaining influence in Russia’s far east,190 and the Kremlin had repeatedly expressed its support for Iraq’s unity.191 But as this section has shown, Russia’s behavior demonstrates concern with its self-interest over any ideological concerns. In this sense, the Kremlin has prioritized influence and leverage over both Baghdad and Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. At the same time, Russia’s economic interests have often dovetailed with its foreign policy of resisting the West.

chapter seven
SYRIA
SINCE THE 1960s, Moscow has been Damascus’s closest ally. Between 1963 and 1991, approximately 50,000 Syrians studied at top Russian schools, such as Moscow State University and the Peoples’ Friendship University, and about a fifth of these Syrians studied specifically at the military academies. Over this period, Moscow also supplied Damascus with some $26 billion in military equipment.192 And the Soviet Union helped build Syria’s chemical weapons. Correspondingly, many Russians moved to Syria during the Cold War, and intermarriage naturally took place. With respect to the student exchanges, the Soviet leadership sought to groom top students from allied countries on whom it could later rely for support. Because Syria was a key to the Soviet position in the Middle East, Syrians were referred to as “allies” and “friends” in public broadcasts and statements.
Under Yeltsin, Syria moved down the list of Russia’s priorities, although it did not disappear entirely. While Syria reportedly began producing its own chemical weapons in the mid-1990s, including the highly toxic nerve agent XV, several reports suggest Moscow’s continued involvement in Syria’s CW development.193 More broadly, relations were reinforced in 1996 when Yevgeny Primakov, as Foreign Intelligence Service director, began his efforts to restore Russia’s influence in the Middle East. Moscow was interested in selling weapons to Syria, whose president, Hafiz al-Assad, thought the Russians could help counterbalance Washington and Israel in the region. In May 1999, Russia and Syria signed a ten-year agreement for “peaceful cooperation on nuclear power,” and that July, Assad made an official visit to Moscow aimed at boosting ties. The Syrian leader expressed support for the Kremlin’s efforts to build a “multipolar” world “without [foreign] diktat.”194

Syria  
dent. In the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Putin rushed to offer condolences to Washington and support for its fight against terrorism, because in his view, he was fighting the same radical insurgency in the North Caucasus. Similarly, Assad presented himself to the West as a secular leader combating his country’s Sunni extremists. Yet Russia and Syria both opposed the Iraq war, given the threat it posed to their national interests and stability as leaders. Putin and Assad alike feared that Saddam’s ouster could be followed by similar attempts against their own leadership, along with a push to promote democratization. As the fighting in Iraq continued, Syria allowed Sunni extremist fighters from around the region to cross into Iraq via Syrian territory. While Syria supported the anti-U.S. insurgency, Russia looked the other way, highlighting the Kremlin’s double standard toward radical Islam: intolerance at home, but support abroad when it suited Moscow’s interests.
A further significant boost to Syria-Russia ties occurred after a PutinAssad meeting on January 24, 2005, when Moscow announced it would write off most of Syria’s debt and sell arms to Damascus in return for Syria’s permission to establish permanent Russian naval facilities in Tartus and Latakia. The ultimate tally would be Russian forgiveness of almost $9.8 billion of Syria’s $13.4 billion debt.195 In Moscow’s calculus, closer ties with Syria provided a response to what it saw as a militarized U.S. foreign policy.
Yet another demonstration of close Russia-Syria ties occurred following the February 2005 assassination of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri, a killing in which Syria was strongly suspected. On the UN Security Council, Russia continuously diluted resolutions calling for Syria to fully cooperate with the investigation because, in Moscow’s view, the international tribunal violated state sovereignty and “unilaterally imposed a decision on Lebanon.” Only in May 2007, after Russia had stalled the process for months, did the Security Council pass Resolution 1757, authorizing the establishment of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.196 In subsequent statements, Russian officials continued stressing the importance of state sovereignty when referring to the tribunal.197 A more likely explanation was that, for Putin, the situation echoed calls for an investigation into the murder of Alexander Litvinenko, the former Russian Federal Security Service and KGB officer who had defected

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
to Britain and probed Putin’s personal connections to the Russian mafia before being poisoned in November 2006 with polonium-210.198
In 2008, Assad was among very few leaders who “completely” supported Russia’s invasion of Georgia. According to Russian press reports, he used the opportunity to request Iskander missiles and other weapons from then president Medvedev, because, according to Assad, Israel had provided training and weapons to the Georgians. The Syrian government, for its part, denied that Assad had expressed readiness to host these weapons. Previously, the Kremlin had disallowed Assad from having the weapons over fears they would harm Israel.199 Upon the conclusion of a 2008 meeting, however, Lavrov told journalists that Russia would supply primarily defensive weapons to Syria, which “will not disturb the strategic balance in the region,” although Russia would still review Syria’s requests for new weapons.200 Furthermore, several days later, Russia’s charge d’affaires, Igor Belyaev, announced to Damascus that Russia would increase its naval presence off Syria’s Mediterranean coast.201
In the ensuing years, Russia emerged as Syria’s primary weapons supplier. From 2007 through 2010, Russian arms sales to Syria reached $4.7 billion, more than twice the figure for the previous four years, according to the Congressional Research Service.202 According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, Russia accounted for 78 percent of Syria’s weapons purchases between 2007 and 2012. And press reports indicate that Russian companies have invested $20 billion in Syria since 2009.203
Since the Syrian uprising began in March 2011, the Kremlin has supported Assad unequivocally, despite statements to the contrary. It has armed Assad, shielded him at the UN Security Council, agreed to take Syria’s crude oil in exchange for refined oil products to sustain the country’s military and economy, and provided loans to stave off Syrian bankruptcy. Although the Kremlin has insisted throughout the crisis that Russia opposes the use of chemical weapons, it has blocked UN resolutions broadly condemning their use, even though these resolutions did not assign blame to any particular party.204 In summer 2013, following a sarin attack in a Damascus suburb, the Moscow-brokered deal to put Syria’s chemical arsenal under international control helped avoid military strikes against the Syrian regime while reportedly allowing Assad to keep certain weapons as bargaining chips.205 In August 2015, as the UN Security
38

Syria  
Council investigated chlorine attacks in Syria, the West believed Assad was responsible. Yet in response, Lavrov said the removal of Assad’s CW arsenal had been unequivocally successful. In Lavrov’s words: “Sometimes publications come out that there could be undeclared chemical weapons in Syria. This is all being checked, here we must avoid unfounded accusations. We have every basis to consider that Syria will continue cooperating closely.” Until September 10, 2015, Russia threatened to wield its veto to resist Security Council efforts to investigate the attacks.206
Russian ships have been involved in several Syria-related incidents in international waters. In summer 2009, even before the Syrian uprising, the cargo ship Arctic Sea was carrying timber and reportedly hijacked off the coast of Sweden—the first Baltic Sea piracy incident in hundreds of years.207 Russia deployed its navy to locate the vessel, which was owned by a Finnish company and manned by a Russian crew. In the absence of information, intense speculation ensued, including the claim that the ship was carrying weaponry to Syria or Iran and that the hijackers were working for Israeli authorities.208 According to Tarmo Kouts, an EU rapporteur on piracy, “Only the presence of cruise missiles on board the ship can explain Russia’s strange behaviour in this whole story.” Kouts noted further that Russia’s emergency response was much stronger than its response when it “engaged in a recent Somali piracy crisis.”209 A senior Spanish prosecutor described the incident as “a clear example” of arms trafficking.210 Other incidents include the following:
 In January 2012, Cyprus customs officials intercepted a Syriabound Russian ammunition ship.211
 In June 2012, a cargo ship traveling from Russia to Syria with weaponry, including Mi-25 attack helicopters, was forced to return to port after its British insurers withdrew cover. The Russian Foreign Ministry confirmed that the weapons were indeed Syria-bound.212
 In February 2013, Finnish customs officials investigated weaponssmuggling allegations after discovering tank parts in a container aboard a ship traveling from Russia to Syria in violation of EU sanctions.213
 Other reports claimed that Russia was shipping weapons from its Black Sea naval ports to the port of Tartus.214
39

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
The Kremlin has also provided Assad with loans. According to flight manifests obtained by ProPublica, Moscow flew more than two hundred tons of “banknotes” to the Syrian regime in summer 2011, during periods when the fighting had escalated and the Syrian economy had begun to decline.215 Such shipments helped prevent Assad’s bankruptcy and allowed him to pay his forces even as Syria’s foreign reserves dwindled.
While the arms sales and military factors are important in Putin’s relationship with Syria, the political side is more important: standing up to the West, in fact exposing it as impotent, while Russia reclaims its Great Power status, signaling to small countries in its orbit that the West will not support them should they try to escape Moscow’s influence, as Georgia did. For the Kremlin, protecting Assad is less about the leader and more about projecting and increasing Russia’s ability to influence events in the Middle East, as well as in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Against the color revolutions that swept the post-Soviet space and, to some degree, the Middle East, paired with Russia’s peaceful domestic protests of 2011–2012, Putin has an interest in ensuring that any prodemocracy effort fails. This magnifies the importance of Syria in the Kremlin’s strategic calculus. As Talal Nizameddin concludes in his recent book, “History may well come to show us that Russian policy towards Syria more than any other country exposed the hallmarks of the Putin era and the direction in which it took Russia.”216

chapter eight
JORDAN, THE GCC, & ISRAEL
GENERALLY SPEAKING, the Kremlin has sought advantageous ties with Middle East capitals from Amman to Riyadh to Jerusalem and stepped in whenever the West retreated.
JORDAN & THE GCC In 2004, after the Beslan tragedy, Putin began outreach to traditional Sunni powers and Western allies, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in addition to Egypt (see chapter 4). Such gestures took place amid a weakened U.S. regional posture owing to its Iraq invasion. At the same time, Putin tried to maintain good ties with Israel—a relationship he had cultivated since coming to power, following a cool period under the Arab-oriented Primakov, who was foreign minister in 1998–1999.217
After 2000, Putin and Jordan’s King Abdullah met multiple times. In addition, the presidents of Chechnya and Ingushetia visited Jordan several times between 2005 and 2007, considering that about 100,000 North Caucasians live in Jordan. The North Caucasian connection mattered to Putin. As a concession toward regional Sunni powers, the Kremlin finally agreed to sanctions, albeit diluted ones, against Iran in December 2006 and again in March 2007.
In February 2007, Putin traveled to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. No Russian—or Soviet—head of state had ever done so before. A number of high-level exchange visits followed over the years. As Putin offered Iran help with nuclear technology, he also sought business for Russia’s nuclear industry in Jordan, Egypt, and the Gulf, and because these states were Iran’s rivals, they wanted technology to keep pace with the Islamic Republic. Putin thus had reason to push these countries away from the West. Gazprom, Lukoil, and Rosneft, along with other Russian companies, sought deals not only with Iran and Iraq but also with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, where Putin pursued major deals involving
41

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
Russia’s banking and space industries, weapons sales, and joint projects on oil and gas.218
The year 2007 also marked a rapid rise in Russia-Jordan trade and economic cooperation. According to the Russian-Jordanian Business Council, bilateral trade “grew substantially and amounted to 169 million dollars (for the period of 10 months in 2007) in comparison to only 64.8 million dollars in 2006.”219 In the Gulf, Russia’s diplomatic and commercial presence grew swiftly as well, culminating in a GCCRussia strategic dialogue, which commenced in November 2011, focusing on issues ranging from security to trade and investment to inter‑ cultural exchange.
In November 2013, Amman hosted the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Russian-Jordanian Commission for the Development of Trade and Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation, at which King Abdullah hailed the “new frontiers” for bilateral partnership, referring specifically to plans to use Russian technology to build Jordan’s first nuclear power plant.220 Indeed, in March 2015 Amman signed a $10 billion deal with Moscow to construct this plant.221
In June 2015, Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman met with Putin after the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum 222 and reportedly signed six agreements, including a nuclear cooperation deal enlisting Russia to help build up sixteen atomic power stations in Saudi Arabia. According to Russia’s Interfax, this agreement “for the first time in the history of Russian-Saudi relations creates a legal basis for cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear energy.”223 Other agreements covered space cooperation, infrastructure development, and Russian arms.224 In July 2015, Riyadh committed to investing $10 billion in Russia—the largest agreement with the desert kingdom to date.225
These agreements should not be overstated—traditional SaudiRussian relations have been largely antagonistic. Specifically, Putin has been resentful of Saudi Arabia’s alliance with the United States, and Russian officials for years accused the Saudis of financing Sunni terrorism within Russia. However, these recent events do point to Saudi frustration with U.S. policies in the region, especially on Syria. Andrei Klimov, deputy chair of the Russian Senate’s international affairs committee, said in July, “Reality is moving Russia and Saudi Arabia together...The Saudis
42

Jordan, the GCC, and Israel  
are learning that they can’t rely on the U.S. for everything, and there’s considerable advantage in developing relations with Russia.”226
As for Russia and Jordan, on October 23, 2015, the two countries agreed to coordinate their military actions on Syria. They set up a “special working mechanism” in Amman, suggesting the possibility that Jordan— another traditional Western ally frustrated with its policies—is moving closer to Moscow. Commenting on this arrangement, Russian foreign minister Lavrov said, “We think that other states that participate in the anti-terrorist fight can join this mechanism as well.”227
As Western ambivalence and reluctance to use greater force persist on the Syria issue, Putin has crossed another effective redline. His outreach to traditional Western Sunni allies through a carrot-and-stick approach shows his desire to replace the West as a security provider in the Middle East. As the West continues to waffle and ignore its allies’ real security needs, Putin has gained the upper hand, exacerbated the Syrian conflict, and further destabilized the region.
ISRAEL Putin’s Israel policy has been driven by several factors. On one, the struggle with Chechnya, Putin has drawn parallels between Russia’s and Israel’s respective struggles against terrorism. Over years, he has made this very comparison in meetings with many top Israeli officials. Ariel Sharon, a Russian speaker who formed a close personal bond with Putin, in November 2003 called the Russian leader “a true friend of Israel.”228 Israel was among the few countries that did not criticize Putin over his actions in Chechnya. Another driver in Putin’s Israel policy involves his emphasis on developing economic ties in the Middle East, and he has correspondingly pursued high-tech trade with Israel in areas including nanotechnology.229 Finally, Putin has sought a Russian role in the Middle East peace process, guided by hopes of replacing the West and of simply appearing important. Indeed, under Putin, Russia has grown increasingly assertive, seeking to make his own imprint on the peace process since joining the Quartet more than a decade ago. In June 2012, Putin traveled to Israel, nine months before Obama made his first visit as U.S. president.230 Meeting with Israeli president Shimon Peres in Jerusalem, Putin said, “It is in Russia’s national interest to provide peace and tranquility in the Middle East, peace and tranquility to the Israeli people. It is not by accident that
43

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
the Soviet Union was among the initiators and supported the creation of the state of Israel.”231 Putin here conveniently left out Stalin’s quick policy reversal after Israel aligned with the West.
Despite improvements in the bilateral relationship, significant differences remain. In March 2006, Hamas leaders came to Moscow on Putin’s invitation and Putin denied that Hamas was a terrorist organization.232 Other major difficulties for Israel have included Moscow’s support for Iran’s nuclear program and arms trade with Syria—arms that could fall into the possession of Hezbollah. Putin’s Syria intervention only increases Israel’s concerns on this front. Frustrated with U.S. policies, Israel in recent years had been working on improving relations with Russia and regional Sunni powers. Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s September 21 meeting with Putin appeared to alleviate some Israeli concerns about Russia’s Syria intervention.233 Yet recent strikes in southern Syria could signal greater problems for Israel if Hezbollah and Iran intensify the ground campaign there. These events again highlight the need for Western powers to attend to the needs of their regional allies, lest they be driven toward Russia.
44

chapter nine
TURKEY
WHEN PUTIN ENTERED  office, Russia’s relations with Turkey were, despite lingering problems, on the rise, and the new Russian president only sought to improve them further. 234 One cause for common feeling with Ankara was the Turkish government’s effective silence on Russia’s human rights abuses in Chechnya. In December 1999, Putin pushed the Russian parliament to approve $1.5 billion in tax breaks for construction of the Blue Stream pipeline, which would carry gas directly from Russia into Turkey, bypassing third countries.235 The same month, Gazprom and Italy’s ENI signed a memorandum to jointly implement Blue Stream.236
In October 2000, Russia’s then prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov toured Turkey, where he signed a number of agreements and pledged to increase natural gas supplies to Turkey. During his visit, Kasyanov said, “The impression I will take to my country is that Turkey and Russia will see one another as partners rather than rivals.”237 The Kremlin began expanding other areas of cooperation with Turkey, such as in trade, arms contracts, and terrorism-related issues.238 In 2001, Igor Ivanov, then Russia’s foreign affairs minister, made an official visit to Turkey that, according to the Turkish government, “gave new impetus to the Turkish-Russian relations...Both sides agreed to add a multidimensional feature to their relations by extending bilateral cooperation to the Eurasian region.”239 Blue Stream would become one of several key bases for Russian-Turkish cooperation, and commercial gas supplies began traveling through this pipeline in February 2003.240
The downturn in Turkish-U.S. relations aided Putin in his outreach to Ankara. Erdogan had denounced U.S. actions in Iraq as “state terror” and continued to say nothing about Russia’s human rights abuses in Chechnya. An alliance with Turkey helped Putin on a number of fronts: Turkey could help contain the Chechen insurgency, Turkey was a large and
45

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
growing market for Russia’s oil and gas exports, and Turkey was in a position to support Russia’s aim to gain observer status in the OIC.241
In late 2004, Putin began his intensified post-Beslan outreach to the Middle East with a December trip to Ankara—the first such visit in thirty-two years for a Russian head of state.242 Upon its conclusion, the two leaders signed a number of agreements. 243 At a joint Russian-Turkish business forum, Putin remarked: “At present, the Russian and Turkish economies are developing dynamically. Their attraction for investors and domestic markets [is] growing. And this circumstance, multiplied by the long history of our joint efforts, is a good basis for promising and productive co-operation.”244
Russian-Turkish trade rose by 60 percent in 2004, as compared to the first half of 2003.245 In 2005, Erdogan made the year’s first official visit to Moscow, on January 10—a visit that further signaled improvements in the relationship246 and was followed by many others. That year, Erdogan expressed his desire to raise bilateral trade with Russia from $10 to $25 billion a year.247 Overall, Russia has benefited more from this relationship than Turkey, given the associated increase in Turkish dependence on Russian energy.
Between 2004 and 2009, Putin and Erdogan met ten times.248 By 2009, Russia had emerged as Turkey’s number-one trading partner, and by 2014 bilateral trade reached approximately $33 billion,249 with Turkey also becoming a top destination for Russian tourists.250 Disagreements between Russia and Turkey, however, had arisen in the context of the Syrian crisis: while Putin had supported Assad unequivocally since the very beginning, Erdogan believed Assad should go. Even so, the two leaders were able to compartmentalize such issues, and on the economic front, talks in 2014 focused on tripling trade by 2020.251
Russia’s current intervention in Syria, however, changed the picture dramatically. In response to two Russian violations of Turkish airspace— on October 3, 2015, by an Su-30 warplane, and again on October 4— Erdogan referred to Chapter 5 of the NATO treaty.252 As Ambassador James Jeffrey writes, Hatay province, in southern Turkey, is populated in part by ethnic Arabs of the Alawite sect of Islam, which adds a layer of complexity from Turkey’s perspective toward Moscow’s Syria intervention and violations of Turkey’s airspace.253 In addition, according to the Turkish military, on October 6 unidentified MiG-29 aircraft put Turkish

F-16 jets on radar lock “for a total of four minutes and thirty seconds” when the F-16s were flying reconnaissance missions over the TurkishSyrian border.254
At an October 6 press conference in Brussels, Erdogan remarked, “If Russia loses a friend like Turkey, with whom it has been cooperating on many issues, it will lose a lot, and it should know that.”255 Putin may think Erdogan has little choice but to cooperate with Russia because of Turkey’s dependence on Russian gas, but a summer 2015 dispute over gas prices delayed Putin’s plan to build a $15 billion gas pipeline in Turkey, which would allow Putin to ship gas into Europe, bypassing Ukraine.256 In the current context, it is unlikely Ankara and Moscow will agree on a price. Furthermore, Erdogan warned after Russia violated Turkey’s airspace that Moscow risks losing a $20 billion contract to build a nuclear power plant in Turkey.257 Turkey has also taken in more than a million Syrian refugees—a number Turkey predicts could reach as high as three or four million after winter 2016, specifically because of Russia’s intervention.258
Following Turkey’s downing of a Russian Su-24 jet on November 24, —Ankara claimed that the plane had briefly violated Turkish airspace and that the Turkish military had issued multiple warnings to the jet prior to the shoot-down—Russian-Turkish relations have declined sharply. Several days before the event, the Turkish foreign minister had reportedly warned Russia’s ambassador to Turkey that Russia’s “intensive” bombing of Syrian Turkmen villages in northern Latakia “could lead to serious consequences.”259
For his part, Putin contended that by shooting down the Russian plane, Turkey had “stabbed Russia in the back”260 and demanded an apology from Erdogan, who refused to comply. Several days after the downing of the plane, Putin announced economic sanctions against Turkey “to ensure national security” and expanded these sanctions in late December 2015.261 Tensions between Russia and Turkey continue with the new year.

CONCLUSION
A LOOK AT  Vladimir Putin’s policy toward the Middle East reveals less of a pure interest in the region itself than in what it represents: economic and political gain, opportunities to reduce Western influence and advance a perception of Russia as a Great Power, and obstruction of efforts toward genuine peace with the aim of profiting from conflict, in what policy expert Stephen Blank has described as a “classic a manifestation of the protection racket familiar to us from the Mafia.”262
Another reason can be found in the Kremlin’s most recent Syria buildup: diversion from domestic problems to ensure Putin’s maintenance of power and the end of international isolation that resulted from his March 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
RUSSIA’S UNCERTAIN FUTURE In reality, Russia is hardly a Great Power. It is facing a number of critical domestic problems: catastrophic population decline, massive health challenges, economic recession, unsustainable military spending at the expense of much-needed infrastructure improvements, and many other issues. Russia is also losing the domestic battle with radical Islam, a situation that will only likely be worsened by its Syria involvement. By traditional indicators, such as GDP, population, and armed forces, Russia is dwarfed by the West. As Russia expert Edward Lucas writes, “The Kremlin’s weapons are at best surprise, bluff and subterfuge, not real muscle.”263 Lucas continues:
From a traditional Western viewpoint, it is the rising powers, not declining ones, that are the worry. Yet with regard to Russia that approach is mistaken. For one thing, the prospect of disintegration—ever growing thanks to the incompetence of the Putin regime—is chilling.264
48

Conclusion  
Therefore, waiting Russia out is the wrong approach—a weak Russia is likely to grow more aggressive and harmful to Western interests in the Middle East, as is the case now with Syria. Pointing to fictional external enemies and pretending to fight global terrorism allow Putin to avoid responsibility for Russia’s domestic problems, and create an illusion of himself as an important world leader. Prior to Putin’s annexation of Crimea, his ratings had dropped to an all-time low.265 Although the annexation boosted his ratings in the short term, Putin will need to continue inventing crises to divert the public’s attention from domestic problems, and his intervention in Syria may not be his last such gambit.
Ultimately, as noted, Putin’s policies are aimed at furthering his own stay in power. Putin appears to be driven by a genuine belief that Western leaders act no differently than he does.266 According to Gleb Pavlovsky, a political consultant to the Putin administration from 1999 to 2011, “Putin doesn’t believe that there is real competition between the political parties in the West. He thinks of it as a game.” George W. Bush reportedly had grown exasperated with Putin in private dealings because Putin did not understand how Western democracy works.267 Regarding international diplomacy, Putin’s approach appears to be guided by Lenin’s kto-kogo, or “who-whom” (who will dominate whom) approach. Moreover, Russia analysts have often raised concerns that Putin’s policies in the Middle East could invite greater instability into Russia.268
Although the West generally accepts the notion of Putin’s high approval ratings and his virtually indefinite stay in power, any poll in an authoritarian country should be taken with a grain of salt, given people’s fear of telling the truth. A deeper look reveals a more complex reality.269 For instance, consider a December 2014 poll by Alexei Kudrin’s human rights and civil society NGO, the Committee of Civil Initiatives, which found that “perceptions of President Vladimir Putin are changing—the country’s residents still do not see an alternative to him, but subconsciously trust in him decreases.” This assessment provides insight into what Russian citizens mean by “approval.”
Other polls confirm that many Russians simply don’t see an alternative to Putin,270 a trend also indicated in private conversations that cannot be captured in a poll. Furthermore, many Russian citizens are voting with their feet. Russian emigration rates rose to 40,000 a year in 2011, around the time Putin announced his return for a third presidential term; in 2013,
49

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
they rose by 76 percent from the previous year. The year 2014 saw the largest increase in emigration since the 1990s, with more than 200,000 people leaving Russia only a month after Putin annexed Crimea.271 The negative trends in the economy have also forced many to search for alternatives to government information sources, such as the Internet and social networks, where they can find views that oppose the Kremlin.272
While these trends point to greater instability than would meet the eye, it is unclear what the future holds. Notably, Russian society is changing. Although the majority of Russians may be unlikely to engage in public protest, private conversations reveal that beneath the surface, many are growing increasingly dissatisfied with Putin and more interested in politics and civic participation. Russia’s liberal opposition and human rights activists have continued to resist the regime after the tragic February 2015 murder of the country’s leading liberal opposition politician, the former deputy prime minister Boris Nemtsov, who in previous years had exposed Putin’s corruption and shortly before his murder was reportedly preparing to release information that proved Russia’s military presence in Ukraine. At the same time, Russia has seen a surge of nationalism and xenophobia, driven by the Kremlin’s propaganda machine. Coupled with the emigration of Russia’s educated elites, these trends could suggest a rise of far-right forces not entirely dissimilar from Germany in the 1930s.273
According to a recent poll from the Levada Center, Russia’s most independent and respected polling organization, 32 percent of respondents expressed positive sentiments about the prospect of Russian ground operations in Syria. To put this in context, Levada notes that approximately 25 percent in Russia always support tough measures.274 According to another recent poll, conducted in November 2015 among 1,600 citizens throughout Russia, two-thirds believe Russia is a Great Power—an increase from 50 percent in 2011275 and 31 percent in 1999. 276 According to the Moscow Times, “enthusiasm over military campaigns in Ukraine and Syria seems to outweigh worries about a deep economic slump.” 277 The same poll, though, showed that 36 percent want to see Russia “as the developed countries of the West.” This remains “the most popular response,” according to Levada.278
As quoted by Levada, the Russian political scientist Dmitry Oreshkin explains:
50

Conclusion  

There is a complex relationship between the historical trajectory of the country and short-term intentions: we traditionally have military and binary thinking—that there is a “we” and there are “enemies.” The authorities use these models to mobilize support, and then act in accordance with these models...This is a problem that leads to cognitive dissonance: [Putin] seems to have proved a strong leader, defender of the Russian people in Ukraine, but... Ukraine went to the West, Crimea is adjusting with great difficulties, Donbass is in trouble. A new-old system of values is introduced, which greatly simplifies the picture of the world: a strong country is one that can bomb neighbors, but not one that creates a model for development. 279
In the Middle East, Putin is likely to continue to strengthen alliances with non-Western actors to maintain his grip on power. Putin’s Russia is thus likely to remain an obstacle to peace and stability in the Middle East, and a proliferator of conflict, rather than the partner the West had hoped for.


On October 31, 2015, Metrojet Flight 9268, a Russian carrier, crashed as it departed Sharm al-Sheikh, killing all 224 passengers on board. While the Islamic State immediately claimed responsibility for the crash, the Russian and Egyptian governments initially resisted acknowledging terrorism as the cause. On November 17, however, Putin announced that the terrorism angle had been confirmed and vowed that the perpetrators would pay.280 After attending a meeting about the crash, he asserted: “We are not going to wipe the tears from our hearts and souls. This will remain

with us forever. But that won’t stop us from finding and punishing the criminals...We will look for them in any point on the planet and we will punish them.”281
Some were surprised that Putin did not immediately blame terrorists for the downed jet. Indeed, as soon as Putin intervened in Syria, Russia analysts privately wondered if an event like the 1999 apartment bombings would happen, handing Putin an excuse to justify Russia’s involvement in the war. A contrarian explanation would be that the admission of terrorism could be seen to weaken Putin’s credentials as a strong leader and protector

51

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST

of his people, thereby reducing support for his Syrian adventure. According to Maxim Trudolyubov, who edits Russia’s influential and respected business daily Vedomosi,282 “It looked like Mr. Putin had led his nation into a deadly quagmire, and his innocent countrymen were paying the price.”283 Trudolyubov observes further that Putin’s admission came only following two additional IS-sparked tragedies: the November 12 suicide attack in Beirut, which claimed some 43 lives, and the Paris attacks of the next day, which killed 130.284
Putin’s emergence from international isolation, with the expressed goal of fighting a common enemy, appeared to pay dividends with Western powers. Less than a month before the Paris attacks, French president Francois Hollande had said, “Putin right now is not our ally in Syria.”285 But on November 16—three days after the Paris attacks and the day before the admission that terrorists had downed the Metrojet—Russia and France agreed to coordinate airstrikes against the Islamic State. According to a poll, 91 percent of French citizens supported working with Putin.286
Another challenge, however, awaited Putin. Russia report-

edly had been bombing Turkmen areas on the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, referred to these strikes on Turkic speakers as attacks on “our brothers and sisters.” This was the context in which Turkey, on November 24, shot down a Russian warplane that reportedly crossed into Turkey’s airspace for some seventeen seconds. Turkish officials claim to have given the plane at least ten warnings over the course of five minutes. Putin henceforth declared that Turkey had stabbed Russia in the back,287 demanded an apology, enacted economic sanctions targeting select Turkish imports, including certain food items, and suggested more sanctions might be forthcoming.288 Putin also managed to blame the West, saying that Russia had given the fighter jet’s plan to the United States, a claim U.S. ambassador to NATO Douglas Lute denied. “The U.S. data that I have seen corroborates Turkey’s version of events,” he said. “The airplane was in Turkey, it was engaged in Turkey, it had been warned repeatedly.”289
Russia had violated the airspace of other NATO allies numerous times in recent years, but never had drawn such a response since the end of the Cold War. Putin

Conclusion  

may have been surprised by the Turkish response, which—if anything—highlighted Ankara’s growing concern over Russia’s actions in Syria. The situation also suggests further escalation is likely, even if the two sides will try to avoid direct military confrontation. Speaking on December 11 at the Russian Defense Department’s expanded board meeting, Putin used stern words, although without naming Turkey directly:
I’d like to warn those who will try again to organize any kind of provocation against our troops. We have taken additional measures to ensure the security of Russian troops and air bases...I order you to act very tough. Any targets that threaten Russia’s group or our

ground infrastructure are to be destroyed immediately.290
Indeed, on December 13, around the time of this writing, Russia fired a warning shot at a Turkish vessel to “avoid collision” in the Aegean Sea, according to Russian sources, although at this point only the Russian version of events is available.
Meanwhile, upon conclusion of the most recent PutinHollande meeting on November 26, the two leaders reportedly agreed to exchange intelligence on the Islamic State and other rebel groups, but they continue to disagree about Assad’s role in Syria.291 Separately, press reports indicate that the Russia-Iran alliance is growing, along with ethnic cleansing against Assad’s opponents.292


POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
The United States should take the following steps to limit the many harmful repercussions of Russia’s involvement in the Middle East:
ÂÂIntensify actions against the Islamic State and start retaking territory. While this policy prescription is valid in its own right given IS’s many threats to regional and global security, it is even more important for blocking Russian encroachment—to a considerable degree in conjunction with Iran—into U.S. security relationships and alliances in the region, on the excuse that Moscow and Tehran are serious about fighting the Islamic State while Washington is not.

53

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
ÂÂLimit cooperation with Russia in the Middle East to areas where it is absolutely necessary. These areas include mission deconfliction, which is necessary for safety. Western policymakers should abandon the hope that Putin’s Russia can be a genuine partner in the near future, and stop providing legitimacy to his regime by treating the Kremlin as an equal.
ÂÂReject “diplomacy” that empowers Russia (and Iran) to define the role of regional states in strategic issues such as IS and Syria. This means working closely and openly with traditional U.S. allies in the region—Saudi Arabia and other GCC states, along with Turkey, Jordan, Iraq, Israel, and Egypt. Avoid at any cost “going behind their backs,” as in the Iranian nuclear talks, which the United States initially kept largely secret from its allies. This initial secrecy contributed to the perception that U.S. diplomacy was aimed at bolstering Iran, particularly given that the deal, from their perspective, opened the door for Iran to create a nuclear weapon.
ÂÂPersuade the EU to keep sanctions on Russia. Putin hopes that his actions in the Middle East will create a justification for Europe to lift the Ukraine-related sanctions. That, in and of itself, reinforces why the sanctions must remain in place. Putin’s intervention in Syria is increasing the refugee flow to Europe. Numerous examples indicate that Putin is not interested in following international rules of conduct—from the war with Georgia in 2008, to the Crimea annexation in 2014, to a failure to seek clearance for Iraq overflights. Putin’s disregard for international rules and norms is another major reason for keeping the sanctions in place until he changes his behavior.
ÂÂTake action to prevent Syrian barrel bombing. A large-scale nofly zone may be unrealistic given that Russian planes are regularly flying over all of Syria. A more limited approach would be to act against the barrel bombs Assad drops from helicopters on civilians. This could help reduce the flow of refugees and provide safe areas where Syrian rebels could train and from which they could conduct operations against Assad and the Islamic State. Actions against the barrel bombs could range from providing antiaircraft guns to fire at the slow, high-flying helicopters to the possible, limited transfer of man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADs).
54

Conclusion  
These dual-purpose systems can also be used for ground combat. Likewise, the West should reach an understanding with the Kremlin that a violation of the barrel-bomb ban would result in the bombing of Assad’s airfields. In seeking a model, the United States should look to Operation Northern Watch, the no-fly zone maintained over Iraq’s Kurdish areas (1991–2003), which employed fewer than a hundred U.S. and British aircraft of all types. Such an approach should work for an area in Syria that is both much closer to Incirlik, also the base for Northern Watch, and considerably smaller than northern Iraq.
ÂÂChange the balance of forces on the ground in Syria. As in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the goal should be not to defeat Assad and his Iranian and Russian allies but rather to convince them that their best outcome is an endless stalemate, and thus encourage true compromise and negotiations. This will only occur if low-cost, lowrisk actions by the United States and its allies force the Assad alliance to escalate in costly ways. Such actions should include providing weapons to Assad’s moderate opponents—including, as noted, MANPADs at some point—to maintain the military balance.
ÂÂAvoid further weakening of traditional U.S. alliances under Putin’s carrot-and-stick pressure. Such a step means acceding to more of U.S. regional allies’ demands—stronger action in Syria to counter Assad and his allies, increased economic aid to Jordan and Iraqi Kurdistan, improved relations with Egypt, much closer diplomatic ties with Israel to match excellent U.S.-Israel military cooperation, and better coordination with Turkey. These countries must feel confident that the United States is more solicitous of their security needs than Putin is, but that the “price” for this U.S. support is keeping the Russians—and Iranians, in some cases—at arm’s length.
ÂÂDon’t neglect Iraq. The most vulnerable of these “traditional” alliances is that with Iraq. If the United States does not better assist Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi in achieving quick victories against the Islamic State, and supporting him and the Najaf religious leadership in their domestic political conflict with Iran’s supporters, Abadi will not keep his commitment to the United States to abstain from further cooperation with Russia.
55

  RUSSIA IN THE MIDDLE EAST
ÂÂPush Russian military forces to overextend themselves. Putin’s Syria intervention has raised the question of the extent of Russian military capabilities. Regardless of what these capabilities are in reality, Putin counts on Western complacency and does not take costs into account when getting involved in Syria, Ukraine, and elsewhere. In the context of Russia’s economic recession, and a number of Russia’s existing military commitments in the post-Soviet space and now in Afghanistan, the West can certainly make it more costly for Putin to stay in Syria, such as by arming Ukrainians.
ÂÂBe prepared to deescalate. As indicated by much experience with Putin and the recent dangerous Turkish-Russian aerial incident, the international community, beginning with the United States, must be ready to deescalate situations that could drag the region into a wider war.
ÂÂIncrease democracy support in Russia. Because the future of Russia’s behavior in the Middle East is driven largely by the Kremlin’s domestic politics, the West should support those in Russia with democratic aspirations. If the West does not support and encourage individuals in Russia who share Western values, these individuals will grow demoralized and, in turn, could become more radicalized. Such a development can only harm U.S. interests.

29. For example, among the first victims of his free-press crackdown was the billionaire, Yeltsin supporter, and Duma deputy Boris Berezovsky, who played an influential role in ending the first Chechen war and owned the prominent ORT TV. Berezovsky was initially among Putin’s chief supporters—indeed, some credit him with contributing to the Yeltsin circle’s choice of Putin as his successor—but he became Putin’s vocal critic after the 2000 presidential election, whereupon he resigned from the Duma to protest Putin’s reforms, which he saw as curtailing democracy. Facing increased pressure, he soon fled to Britain, where he eventually died under suspicious circumstances. Some in Moscow and in the West felt Putin’s apparent move could have been a solely personal attack against Berezovsky, rather than part of what would emerge as an increasingly authoritarian pattern.

41. Whereas this advancement of Russia’s exceptionalism—which, at its core, is very different from American exceptionalism—may seem new, it is indeed a product of Russia’s history. According to this Russian perspective, which originates in the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, the progenitor of the Russian state, God endowed Moscow with the sacred mission to preserve and expand the only true Christian faith—Russian Orthodoxy—and stand in opposition to Roman Catholicism and Ottoman Constantinople. For centuries, Moscow officials have used the assertion of cultural uniqueness and civilizational mission as a political, cultural, and social justification for war, imperial expansion, and diversion from economic problems, and as cover for their own illegal activities or sheer incompetence. Putin is simply the latest embodiment of this approach. Anders Åslund and Andrew Kuchins,

73. It is difficult to accurately estimate the number of Russia’s Muslims, in part because the Russian census breaks down constituencies by ethnicity, not religion, and excludes migrants, a large number of whom are from Central Asia. Since 2004, estimates have ranged from about 14 to 23 million. See results of the latest Russian census, conducted in 2010: http://

Notes  
www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/perepis2010/croc/perepis_itogi1612. htm. A U.S. estimate, from the 2004 Annual Report on International and Religious Freedom (see “Section 1: Religious Demography”), gives a range of 14 to 20 million: see http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2004/35480. htm. While the Pew Research Center and Russia’s official census estimate 14 million Muslims, the Russian Orthodox Church estimates 20 million. Ravil Gaynutdin, head of Russia’s Council of Muftis, estimated 23 million in August 2005, with this figure notably including the approximately 3–4 million migrant Muslims from Central Asia and Azerbaijan. See Conrad Hackett, “5 Facts about the Muslim Population in Europe,” Pew Research Center, January 15, 2015, http://www.pewresearch.org/ fact-tank/2015/01/15/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/, and “Russia’s Turning Muslim, Says Mufti,” Times of London, August 6, 2005. For a more detailed, up-to-date discussion, see Daniel Pipes, “Predicting a Muslim-Majority Russia,” August 6, 2005 (updated September 13, 2014), http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2005/08/predicting-a-majority-muslim-russia. The present study assumes the higher end of the range, based on migrants from Central Asia and Russia’s overall Muslim population growth. Private author conversations with experts on Russia’s Muslims confirm this assessment.
74. This is the case even when one uses the low-end 14 million estimate: see Conrad Hackett, “5 Facts about the Muslim Population in Europe,” Pew Research Center, January 15, 2015, http://www.pewresearch.org/facttank/2015/01/15/5-facts-about-the-muslim-population-in-europe/.

Here, too, Putin saw the hand of Western intervention, especially after the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. In some cases of revolutions or protests, such as in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, the government used violence against peaceful protestors, unlike in Ukraine. 91. Lincoln A.

118. Another example illustrates the Kremlin’s relativist approach to Islamism: its siding with the Islamists after protests erupted in February 2006 in many Muslim-majority countries, several months after the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Indeed, the same month, the government shut down the local newspaper Gorodskie Vesti in the city of Volgograd after the paper printed a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad along with Jesus, Moses, and Buddha. Another local paper, Nash Region (Our Region), was ultimately forced to shut down after republishing the original Jyllands-Posten cartoons. Most notably, the government did all this amid a virtual absence of public outcry against the cartoons. This episode showed that Putin will justify support for radical Islamism if it suits his aims.

193. As reported in Der Spiegel in 2012, Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, a Yeltsin advisor—ironically, on eliminating chemical weapons—was a frequent visitor to Damascus and “played a leading role there.” See Ronen Bergman, Juliane von Mittelstaedt, Matthias Schepp, and Holger Stark, “Israel’s Red Line: Fate of Syrian Chemical Weapons May Trigger War,” Der Spiegel, July 13, 2012, http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/israel-prepares-plans-toneutralize-syrian-chemical-weapons-a-847203.html). Kuntsevich allegedly established connections with leading members of the Syrian regime, who paid him large sums in exchange for details on how to manufacture VX. According to Der Spiegel, “He reportedly also shipped 800 liters of chemicals to Syria that were required to produce the poison gas.” Another example is Yuri Ivanov, a retired Russian general who had served as deputy director of Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU); Ivanov disappeared from a coastal Syrian town while reportedly en route to meet Syrian military intelligence officers. Journalists in the Middle East, according to the Moscow Times, speculated that the Mossad killed both these men because “unlike Russian leaders, Israelis do not see Syria’s chemical weapons program as a parlor game for scoring political debating points” (see the Der Spiegel piece by Bergman et al. referenced above).

267. Putin routinely justified his own actions by comparing them to what he perceived as similar U.S. actions. For example, he reportedly defended his control of the Russian media by saying, “Don’t lecture me about the free press, not after you fired that reporter,” referring to CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather, who was stepping down after his report on George W. Bush’s National Guard service turned out to be fraudulent. See Peter Baker, “The Seduction of George W.

“ In the Middle East, Putin is likely to continue to strengthen alliances with non-Western actors to maintain his grip on power. Thus, rather than the partner the West had hoped for, Putin’s Russia is likely to remain both an obstacle to peace and stability and a pro” liferator of conflict in the region.

Over the past several years, the international community has witnessed the return of Russia as an important global actor. Is this a fundamentally new phenomenon, or is it the result of the Kremlin’s opportunism under President Vladimir Putin and the transformation of his foreign policy?
The current activist Russian posture in many far-flung corners of the world goes beyond the two previously articulated key elements of its foreign policy: its claim to a sphere of privileged interests around its immediate periphery, which was staked out in the wake of the 2008 war with Georgia, and its refusal to accept the post–Cold War security order in Europe, decisively affirmed with the 2014 annexation of Crimea. More recently, the Kremlin has expanded the geographic scale of its foreign policy with active outreach in parts of the world where a Russian presence has not been a factor for nearly three decades, since the Soviet Union scaled back its overseas ambitions.
At first glance, Moscow’s attempts to create a web of relationships and project influence in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and other parts of the world appear to be a new element of Russian foreign policy. However, that conclusion would be mistaken. Russian foreign policy has been building up to its present expansive phase for over two decades. Moreover, its ambitions have much deeper roots. Continuity with the Soviet era and even earlier periods of Russian history is a hallmark of the Kremlin’s current foreign policy and the toolkit it relies on to advance its goals. It is therefore essential to review the foreign policy legacy of the Soviet Union. Core components of the current Russian toolkit have withstood the test of time, and there is every indication that Moscow will continue to rely on them, even in a post-Putin era.
Back to the Future
While usually associated with Putin, Russia’s contemporary activist foreign policy was, in fact, launched before he even became president. It was first launched by Yevgeny Primakov, who was appointed Russian foreign minister in 1996. He formulated what became known as the Primakov Doctrine. According to Primakov, Russia would no longer follow the lead of Western powers, especially the United States, but would instead position itself as an independent center of power on the world stage, contributing to the development of a multipolar world as an alternative to the U.S.led unipolar order. Primakov’s successor as foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, summed up his predecessor’s influence in October 2014, saying:
The moment he took over the Russian Foreign Ministry heralded a dramatic turn of Russia’s foreign policy. Russia left the path our Western partners had tried to make it follow after the breakup of the Soviet Union and embarked on a track of its own.1

This vision has guided Russian foreign policy ever since. Many Western policymakers and observers were slow to take Primakov’s vision at face value, convinced that Russia was too weak to go it alone, let alone develop an alternative to the post-1989, U.S.-led international order. As the Russian economy improved and the Kremlin acquired more resources to implement the doctrine, its policy evolved from a relatively passive refusal to accept Western initiatives to a more active form of resistance; eventually it morphed into an activist foreign policy with an ambitious geographic scope. In addition to leveraging the significantly greater resources at its disposal, Russian foreign policy has reflected the Kremlin’s willingness to take advantage of a propitious external environment and chip away at the U.S.-led international order.
Success begets more success, and since Putin’s return to the presidency in 2012, his record has been enhanced by what Russian officialdom sees as several important wins. The annexation of Crimea, the war in eastern Ukraine, the military deployment in Syria, the tense military standoff with the West in the Baltic and Black Seas, and the interference in U.S. and European domestic politics have all enhanced Russia’s image as a major power with significant power projection capabilities, as well as Putin’s reputation as a bold and skilled leader. These victories have also demonstrated to the world Russia’s propensity for risk-taking and punching above its weight, along with its improved capabilities for warfare and operations short of war in multiple domains—land, air, space, sea, cyber, and information operations.
Moreover, the Kremlin’s record since 2012 suggests that it will not be deterred or constrained by economic difficulties. The Russian economy has performed poorly since then, with growth hampered by a failure to institute long-overdue structural reforms and excessive dependence on exporting hydrocarbons and other raw materials. But economic difficulties have not put a brake on Russian activism abroad. To the contrary, the Kremlin’s ability to withstand both domestic economic difficulties and Western sanctions without changing course is a sign of Moscow’s commitment to an activist foreign policy as a long-term choice of the country’s leadership.
In addition to its determination and the considerable resources at its disposal, the Kremlin’s foreign policy record has benefited from opportunities presented by the West’s actions or inaction. For example, the annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine took place against the backdrop of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) making clear that it would not intervene and risk a war with Russia over Ukraine. Similarly, Russia’s military deployment to Syria took place after the United States and its allies had demonstrated that they had little appetite for intervening there.
Elsewhere, long-term conflicts, such as those in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, or the unfinished business of post-conflict reconstruction, such as in the Balkans, have presented Russia with opportunities to insert itself and create new facts on the ground. In the United States and Europe, growing political divisions, the proliferation of information providers, and popular frustration with
2

governing elites in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis have exposed targets for Russian interference.
Russian agents did not cause these long-term conflicts or cleavages inside Western societies, but they have used them to advance their goals, which vary depending on the circumstances. In many instances, the Kremlin has relied on a diverse toolkit that creates the appearance of operating one step removed from the Russian government (through a range of actors including state-owned corporations such as Rosatom and Rosneft, private security companies such as the Wagner Group, organized crime syndicates, hackers, and information operation organizations such as the Internet Research Agency).
Western perceptions of post-Soviet Russia have been heavily affected by the country’s economic and political implosion and foreign policy retreat during the 1990s. Against that backdrop, the ambition and dynamism of Russian foreign policy since Putin’s 2012 return to the presidency appears to be a relatively new phenomenon. It isn’t. Moscow’s post-2012 foreign policy fits comfortably in the longstanding historical and intellectual tradition of Soviet and even pre-Soviet Russian foreign policy.
The Troika of Russian Foreign Policy
Contemporary Russian foreign policy displays the unmistakable presence of three centuries-old drivers of Moscow’s posture on the world stage. Chief among these drivers is Russia’s quest for strategic depth and secure buffers against external threats, which, considering the country’s geography and absence of natural protective barriers between it and neighboring powers, has guided its geographic expansion. Along with physical insecurity and expansion, the second key driver of Russian foreign policy has been its ambition for recognition as a great power, which the Kremlin has long seen as necessary for legitimizing its geographic conquests and geopolitical ambitions. The third driver, related to the first two, is Russia’s complicated relationship with the West, which combines rivalry with the need for cooperation.
These recurrent themes are important. They highlight the degree to which Russian foreign policy in the Putin era is a continuation of many pursuits that are, by turns, decades- and centuries-old and were embraced by previous Russian governments regardless of their political persuasion. The historical record also performs an important legitimizing function for the citizens of the Russian state, which is less than three decades old, cementing the state’s claim to be the heir to a long, illustrious tradition dating back centuries. References to this tradition thus legitimize the Putin government’s ambitious overseas pursuits and present them as a matter of historical continuity and as an integral part of what Russia is.

Geography and Strategic Depth It is hard to overestimate the role of geography as a driver behind Russia’s foreign policy. The Russian state and its security policy have been shaped by the absence of natural geographic barriers— oceans, rivers, or mountains.2 Geography has shaped Russian identity and its rulers’ understanding of security throughout the entire existence of the Russian state. Throughout the centuries, contemporary Russia, the Soviet Union, imperial Russia, and the principality of Muscovy have all faced the challenge of securing a vast stretch of territory from neighbors perceived to be hostile to the west, south, and east. To secure its territory, the Russian state acquired more territory, which, in turn, had to be secured from ever-present external threats of one kind or another. In the words of historian Stephen Kotkin, “Whatever the original causes behind early Russian expansionism—much of which was unplanned—many in the country’s political class came to believe over time that only further expansion could secure the earlier acquisitions. Russian security has thus traditionally been partly predicated on moving outward, in the name of preempting external attack.”3 The loss of territory, as was the case after the two great dislocations Russia experienced in the twentieth century—first after the 1917 revolution and the 1918 Brest-Litovsk Treaty, and later after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union—resulted in a profound sense of Russian insecurity and a renewed quest to regain strategic depth. Regaining that depth was the key task of the Soviet government as soon as the country began to recover from the trauma of the revolution and the civil war, and again after Moscow regained a measure of strength after the collapse of the 1990s.

Great Power Ambitions The quest for recognition as a great power has been both the result of Russia’s geographic expansion and its driver. Geographic expanse was and is, in the eyes of Russian leaders, central to their claim to recognition as a great power. Such recognition, in turn, has been needed to lend a veneer of legitimacy to territorial conquests. Perhaps precisely because they have had to struggle repeatedly for such recognition, Russia’s rulers have been particularly sensitive to any suggestion that Russia does not belong in the ranks of major powers.

In the mid-nineteenth century, Russian historian and writer Nikolay Danilevsky complained about Russia’s unfair treatment by Europe, which had turned a blind eye to Prussian and Austrian aggression against Denmark following the annexation of two Danish provinces yet criticized Russia’s efforts to protect the rights of its coreligionists in “barbaric” Turkey.4 Danilevsky’s complaint was, in effect, a precursor of Putin’s lament about the West’s double standards in dealing with Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the severing of Kosovo from Serbia.5
For the leaders of the independent Russia that emerged from the Soviet collapse, the Soviet and Russian imperial legacy appeared to serve as both an inspiration and a justification for their claim to great power status. They found ample philosophical rationales for their claim. In the words of noted Russian political philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, empire and great power status constitute the essence of Russian identity even when the country is experiencing challenges and setbacks, in large part because of its spiritual and material wealth.6 As early as 1993, the official Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation included, among other foreign policy priorities, the objectives of “furthering integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States” and ensuring Russia’s active role on the world stage as a “great power.”7 With Primakov’s rise to the helm of the Russian foreign policy establishment in 1996, great power ambitions again became the Kremlin’s driving force. In his first news conference as foreign minister, Primakov said, “Despite the present difficulties, Russia was and is a great power and its foreign policy should correspond with that.”8 Putin embraced this vision when he became president in 2000, and it has served as a cornerstone of his leadership ever since.
Of particular importance to the Putin government has been the military record of the Russian state and its numerous conquests. Putin issued a presidential order in 2012 reconstituting the Russian Military-Historical Society.9 Long-serving Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky has been an active patron of the society as well. The expansion of the Russian state by force of arms—including numerous victories over Poland, Sweden, the Ottoman Empire, and Central Asia—make up an integral part of the foundational narrative of the contemporary Russian state. This narrative is reinforced by a sprawling state propaganda apparatus, official government activities, and educational curricula.
Several historical events are featured prominently in this narrative. Russia’s defeat of Napoleon has been treated as a uniquely important event because of its significance to the European order in the nineteenth century, as well as for being an accomplishment that cemented Russia’s status as a great power. The victory over Nazi Germany in World War II is treated as the crowning achievement of the Soviet state, which saved not just the Soviet Union and Europe but the whole world from fascism. This triumph presently makes up the most important part of Russia’s national narrative.
8

As a whole, this legacy provides both the justification and the motivation for Russia to pursue its ambitions not just around its vast periphery but well beyond its shores.
Uneasy Relations With the West
Moscow’s uneasy relationship with the West for centuries has been one of the most prominent features of its foreign policy. On the one hand—from Peter the Great’s founding of the new Russian capital on the Baltic shores to Catherine the Great’s engagement with leading European Enlightenment thinkers of the day, Czar Alexander I’s securing Russia’s place in the circle of major European powers to Joseph Stalin’s consolidation of the Soviet Union’s hold on Eastern Europe— Russia long has been an integral part of Europe and its political and security fabric.
On the other hand, throughout Russian history since the time of Peter the Great, Russian elites, political thinkers, and cultural figures have questioned Russia’s European choice and relationship with Europe. In a more recent and very telling sign of that ambivalence, Foreign Minister Lavrov wrote in 2016 that, over the centuries, Russia has seen itself as part of Europe and the West, as better than the West, as different and unique from the West, and as representing a crucial link between the East and the West.10 The biggest obstacle that has kept Russia from having a closer and more stable relationship with Europe, according to Lavrov, has been Europe’s inability or unwillingness to simply let Russia be Russia, and its insistence on having Moscow conform to European norms— something that no Russian leader or the people of Russia would ever accept. Moscow’s claim to great power status has derived from its victories in the West, against Napoleon and Hitler. But Russia’s biggest setbacks too have been delivered by the West—in the Crimean War and in the Cold War— and these setbacks remain the biggest drivers of Moscow’s security and defense policy.11
As was the case during the Cold War, Russian policy toward the West has long had an important ideological dimension. During the Soviet era, the ideological competition was between Soviet communism and democratic capitalism. After a relatively brief period when Russia attempted to join the West, Moscow has embraced an overtly anti-Western ideology. Communism has been replaced by a mix of nationalist, authoritarian, and state-capitalist ideas as an alternative to the West’s notion of liberal democratic capitalism. The concept of Russia as a besieged fortress facing hostile Western designs and influences is a key tool the regime uses to mobilize the political support of Russian elites and ordinary citizens alike.
Old Habits Don’t Die
In addition to a legacy of complicated geopolitics, great power ambitions, and a difficult relationship with the West, the new Russian state has inherited from its Soviet predecessor a time-tested foreign policy toolkit. While some elements of this toolkit fell into disuse early in the post-Soviet period
CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE | 9

when Russia was struggling with a series of domestic crises, these tools have been taken up again by the country’s foreign policy and national security establishment as Moscow has returned to the world stage as an increasingly assertive actor.
George Kennan wrote in “The Sources of Soviet Conduct”:
. . . the Kremlin is under no ideological compulsion to accomplish its purposes in a hurry . . . and it can afford to be patient. These precepts are fortified by the lessons of Russian history: of centuries of obscure battles between nomadic forces over the stretches of a vast unfortified plain. Here caution, circumspection, flexibility and deception are the valuable qualities . . . Its [the Soviet Union’s] political action is a fluid stream which moves constantly, wherever it is permitted to move, toward a given goal. . . . The main thing is that there should always be pressure, unceasing constant pressure, toward the desired goal. There is no trace of any feeling in Soviet psychology that that goal must be reached at any given time.12
Russian foreign policy in the Putin era fits Kennan’s description from more than half a century ago. The Kremlin’s approach has involved the relatively low-cost, limited use of military force in combination with other nonmilitary instruments of national power. Information operations, propaganda and disinformation, cyber operations, trade embargoes, and a vast array of other tools have been integrated into what has become commonly known as hybrid warfare. The current policy discussions in Western capitals often create the impression that Moscow has come up with a fundamentally new toolkit. In reality, an extensive reliance on such tools has long been a feature of Russian domestic politics and foreign policy.
An Instrument of Domestic Political Consolidation
From its earliest days, the Soviet state and its leaders weaponized information and ideology in their struggle for survival at home and in pursuit of greater influence abroad. Manipulation of information for political purposes was adopted by the Bolshevik government as a key tool for controlling the population. The Bolsheviks saw information and propaganda as essential for mobilizing the masses in support of the new regime.
Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, understood the role of ideas as a tool for motivating people and controlling the masses. The Bolsheviks relied on then novel, but now familiar, techniques—posters, fliers, mass rallies, news manipulation, and cooptation of the creative community of writers, poets, filmmakers, and artists. Specially dedicated trains reached distant rural audiences with content manipulated specifically to strike an emotional chord, transcend great distances, and bridge ideological differences between Moscow and far-flung provinces. By applying
10

these techniques in combination with violence, the Bolsheviks succeeded in imposing their vision on the population of the vast country.13
In Service of a Young State’s Foreign Policy
In 1919, the Bolshevik government established the Communist International—also known as the Comintern. Its initial purpose was to control foreign Communist parties and promote revolutionary ideology and the revolutionary struggle in the capitalist camp. But as the revolutionary fervor subsided in Europe and as the Bolsheviks consolidated their victory over the old regime in Russia, they focused on the task of state building. The Comintern morphed from an instrument of revolutionary subversion of the Soviet Union’s capitalist opponents. Instead, it became a vehicle for spreading Soviet influence abroad through a network of agents and front organizations, financial assistance, engagement with and infiltration of foreign Communist parties, and intelligence collection.
Throughout its existence, the Comintern adjusted its institutional positions to suit the needs of Soviet foreign policy. When Soviet foreign policy pursued a system of collective security against Nazi Germany, the Comintern overcame its ideological differences with other left-leaning European parties in the name of their shared opposition to fascism. But with the shift in Soviet foreign policy toward Germany and the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, the Comintern welcomed the pact and embraced the policy of nonintervention.14 That stance changed again when Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, and the Comintern embraced the Allied cause. As an extension of that shift and a step toward strengthening the anti-German alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States, the Comintern was dissolved in 1943 with its final appeal endorsing the anti-Hitler coalition and the liberation war against “fascism and its allies and vassals.”15
With the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War, the Soviet government reconstituted elements of the former Comintern network in 1947 under the title of the Communist Information Bureau, or the Cominform. It resumed some of the old Comintern’s coordinating functions to help ensure Soviet control over Communist parties in Europe and mobilize them as agents of Soviet foreign policy in Moscow’s confrontation with the West. The Cominform existed until 1956, when it was disbanded as part of the relative thaw and ideological relaxation that followed the death of Stalin. Subsequently, the task of managing relations with foreign Communist parties and movements fell to the International Department of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee.

Targeting the West and the Rest
The lower public profile of the new organizational home of the Kremlin’s foreign influence operations did not mean that its reliance on the familiar toolkit—including ideological subversion and manipulation, disinformation, use of proxies, assassinations, and intelligence gathering, as well as other economic and military means—had ended. On the contrary, the Kremlin expanded its arsenal for international engagement to include—besides the International Department of the Central Committee and (obviously) the Committee for State Security (KGB)—a wide range of academic, cultural, and commercial organizations; the Peace Committee; and even the Russian Orthodox Church, to name just a few. Moscow used these entities for a wide range of activities that included providing cover for outright KGB intelligence gathering and enlisting friendly and often unsuspecting agents of influence in support of Soviet-championed causes.16
The history of the Cold War is rich in examples of Soviet reliance on all of these organizations in order to target hostile émigré groups; penetrate Western societies and, in particular, political and national security elites and undermine their political cohesion; shape public opinion; and mobilize significant segments of the population in support of Soviet policies. A 1981 U.S. State Department study noted:
The approaches used by Moscow include control of the press in foreign countries; outright and partial forgery of documents; use of rumors, insinuation, altered facts, and lies; use of international and local front organizations; clandestine operation of radio stations; exploitation of a nation’s academic, political, economic, and media figures as collaborators to influence policies of the nation.17
One of the most vivid examples of Soviet influence operations was Moscow’s campaign intended to undermine the U.S.-Egyptian relationship and the Camp David peace process. The Kremlin’s campaign relied on forgeries, such as a fake State Department document, delivered to the Egyptian embassy in Rome, that made offensive references to then Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and other Arab leaders. Similarly, a fake Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) report, which was cited in a Cairobased news magazine, was critical of Islamic groups and alleged that they posed an obstacle to U.S. policy.18
Perhaps the biggest campaign ever mounted by the Soviet Union’s foreign influence apparatus was aimed at the issue of NATO theater nuclear forces modernization in Europe. This intense, multiyear, multipronged Soviet effort relied on widespread disinformation, intimidation and fear mongering, the exploitation of genuine public concerns about an escalating nuclear arms race, the use of proxy agents, and the infiltration of bona fide public organizations. The Kremlin helped fuel a groundswell of opposition to NATO deployments of Pershing II and ground-launched cruise
12

missiles in Europe in response to the Soviet Union’s deployment of SS-20 intermediate-range nuclear ballistic missiles.19
Other less expansive, but no less malign, disinformation activities also took place. These efforts included KGB-promoted stories in the Indian press about the United States’ purported involvement in the assassination of prime minister Indira Gandhi and plans by senior U.S. officials to break up India,20 and fake documents ostensibly proving that a U.S. military lab developed and spread the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as part of a bioweapons program.21
Expanding the Kremlin’s Global Reach
Soviet competition with the West was not limited to Europe and the Middle East. With the weakening and eventual demise of the West’s colonial empires in Africa and parts of Asia, and the rise of leftist movements in Latin America, the Kremlin saw new opportunities to expand its global reach. The most notable examples of Soviet global ambitions include the forging of a long-term relationship with Cuba, which brought the Soviet Union and the United States to the brink of nuclear war in 1962; involvement, both direct and through surrogates, in the protracted civil war in post-colonial Angola beginning in 1975; support for the African National Congress’s struggle against the apartheid government in South Africa; and assistance to various anticolonial and leftist movements in Africa—including those in Mozambique, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to name just a few.
Soviet involvement in these countries consisted of direct military support in conflict zones, arms sales, the deployment of military advisers and technicians, civilian technical assistance, and educational opportunities in Soviet universities, such as Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, that specialized in the training and (on occasion) the recruitment by Soviet intelligence services of professionals from countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In addition to direct Soviet involvement, Moscow extended its influence through personnel from Soviet bloc countries— including East Germans, Czechoslovaks, and Cubans—who helped deliver security assistance, intelligence training and operational support, economic development projects, and ideological indoctrination.
In the Western Hemisphere, Soviet involvement manifested itself in the support provided to leftist governments and movements. Soviet engagement in the hemisphere had deep roots reaching back to the early post-1917 revolution period, when leftist or communist Latin American intellectuals—like Mexican artists Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, as well as Peruvian intellectual José Carlos Mariátegui—were inspired by the example of the first proletarian state, its socialist experiment, and its vibrant revolutionary culture. In that respect, these Latin American intellectuals were no different
CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE | 13

from many European counterparts who entertained hopes that the Soviet experiment would provide a viable alternative to capitalism and, later, fascism.
The socialist current in Latin American politics during the Cold War, which gave rise to a number of leftist governments, was suppressed by a series of reactionary coups in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Guatemala. Washington supported these coups to varying degrees, thus feeding a narrative of resistance to U.S. imperialism in Latin America. This narrative, in turn, created a favorable contrast for Soviet policy toward the region, support for Cuba’s revolutionary government, and antiimperialist rhetoric. Moscow’s limited reach and U.S. opposition kept the Soviets from gaining a foothold in Latin America, but it was not for a lack of trying.
A few particular examples are noteworthy. In Chile, for instance, the Soviet Union embraced the socialist government of president Salvador Allende and was highly critical of the military government of General Augusto Pinochet, who led the 1973 coup that overthrew Allende. Perhaps the most ambitious Soviet effort to gain a foothold in Latin America—besides Cuba—occurred in Nicaragua in the 1980s. Through direct engagement and Cuban proxies, Moscow delivered multifaceted assistance to the leftist Sandinista government that came to power after the previous government led by Anastasio Somoza Debayle was overthrown in 1979. In this instance, the Soviets provided financial support, economic development projects, humanitarian assistance, and—most importantly—security and military assistance as well as weapons deliveries.
Use of Proxies and Covert Military Deployments
Whether in Latin America or elsewhere, the use of proxy agents and covert operations has been a recurring motif in Moscow’s foreign policy agenda before, during, and after the Cold War. At the end of Leo Tolstoy’s novel Anna Karenina, the protagonist Count Alexei Vronsky, a guards officer and a wealthy nobleman, leaves for Serbia as a volunteer in the fight against the Ottoman Empire. In the much more recent past, Russian volunteers fought in the Balkan wars in the 1990s and even more recently in eastern Ukraine. Volunteers, military personnel ostensibly on leave from their units, Cossacks, contractors hired by private security companies, and other types of proxies have returned to the toolkit of Russian foreign policy.
Long before the identification of Russia’s so-called little green men and polite people in Ukraine, such tactics were a mainstay of Soviet-era foreign policy. The record of Soviet military engagement—direct, as well as through surrogates—ranges from dispatching regular military personnel under aliases to participate in the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War to using Cuban proxies in the Angola crisis in the mid-1970s.22
14

Soviet personnel and equipment were deployed covertly in crisis zones in various parts of Asia and the Middle East throughout the Cold War. Soviet military pilots secretly flew missions during the Korean War and in Yemen in the 1960s and 1970s.23 During a 1962 military crisis between Indonesia and the Netherlands, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev secretly deployed so-called volunteers—along with Soviet submarines, naval vessels, and jets—to fight on behalf of the government of Indonesian president Sukarno, who was seeking to annex part of Papua New Guinea.24 In 1970, Moscow surreptitiously sent Soviet fighter jets and air defense units to Egypt during the so-called War of Attrition with Israel, helping the Egyptian armed forces curtail Israeli air superiority. A secret operation by the Israeli Air Force later successfully lured Soviet pilots into unexpected aerial combat, leading to the unpublicized downing of five Soviet MiG aircraft.25 This 1970 battle was the first and only known instance of a direct Israeli military strike on Soviet forces during the Cold War.
The Most Sinister Tool
The most sinister tool at the disposal of the Kremlin during the Cold War was the assassination of political enemies and defectors. Targeted assassinations of émigrés and political opponents, which have figured prominently in the Kremlin’s various campaigns against its enemies, have deep roots in Soviet history.26 One of the earliest known Soviet intelligence operations directed against an émigré political opponent was purportedly undertaken by the KGB’s predecessor, the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU), against Boris Savinkov, the leader of an anti-Soviet organization of Russian exiles in France.27 In 1924, he was lured back to Russia, arrested, convicted in a show trial, and probably killed by prison guards. The OGPU operation against him served as the basis for a popular Soviet-era television miniseries glorifying the country’s intelligence services.28
Savinkov was not the Kremlin’s only such victim. The best-known Soviet political assassination was carried out against Leon Trotsky in Mexico in 1940 by Spanish communist and Soviet agent Ramón Mercader. The assassin spent two decades in prison, but upon his release he was awarded the highest Soviet decoration for bravery.29 There have been many other targets, including Ukrainian nationalist leader Stepan Bandera, who was assassinated in 1959 with poison fired from a specially designed gun,30 and Bulgarian dissident writer Georgi Markov, who was killed in London in 1978.31
Moscow’s hand in such killings often has been hard to identify or establish, according to a declassified 1964 CIA assessment.32 The Soviet intelligence services often sought to create the impression that targets had died from heart attacks, accidents, or natural causes. At the same time, the regime’s appetite for such extreme methods was, in the CIA’s view, tempered by the risk that such activities could be attributed to Moscow and create undesirable public controversy. The Soviet leadership rarely viewed senior foreign political figures as assassination targets. Known examples
CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE | 15

include aborted plans in the mid-1950s for an attack on Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito and KGB involvement in the turmoil and high-level political killings that preceded the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
Most of these Soviet activities ceased with the collapse of the Soviet economy and the political turbulence that brought the Soviet Union to its end. However, as recent experience of Russian engagement in Africa, Latin America, and other far-flung locales has demonstrated, Moscow’s longrange geopolitical ambitions did not disappear with the Soviet Union. Rather, they provide contemporary Russian foreign policy with important historical roots that feed it.
The Past Is Prologue
In March 1918, the desperate new Bolshevik government of Russia signed the Treaty of BrestLitovsk, which enabled it to leave World War I. Politically, economically, and militarily, the country was in ruins. The Bolsheviks retreated from vast holdings of the Russian Empire—most of Poland, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic states, and Finland in Europe. In the Caucasus, Russia ceded parts of its territory to Turkey. Meanwhile, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia declared independence. A decade later, most of these lands were back in the Soviet Union.
In 1991, the Soviet Union, with its economy and its political system collapsed, dissolved peacefully, retreating from Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic states, Moldova, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia. A decade later, with economic and political restoration under way, Russia was in the process of reestablishing various forms of control over its neighbors. By 2008, Russia was strong enough to assert—after a brief war with Georgia—that it was intent on maintaining its control over the vast region’s security affairs and blocking any prospect of NATO and European Union enlargement in its backyard. Again in 2014, Russia reaffirmed its determination and willingness to use force with the annexation of Crimea.
Several key lessons follow from this retrospective of Russian foreign policy.
• Today, Russian foreign policy has embraced many of the same ambitions that drove Soviet foreign policy during an earlier era. Whether Soviet or Russian, the ambitions of the country’s foreign policy far exceed the “sphere of privileged interests” claimed by then president Dmitry Medvedev in the aftermath of the 2008 war with Georgia.33 These ambitions manifested themselves even before the country was able to act on them. Once Russia recovered a measure of its economic strength, political stability, and military muscle, it did not take long to reclaim a significant part of the legacy of Soviet foreign policy. Some significant elements of the Soviet era—rigid ideological guidelines and a vast pool of resources—are missing from a policy that now reflects greater flexibility and adaptability,

lacks ideological constraints, and blends opportunism with the careful use of relatively modest resources.
• Along with those ambitions, Russian foreign policy has inherited a diverse and tested toolkit to advance the country’s geopolitical ambitions. The instruments in this toolkit range from information operations and propaganda to subversion and assassinations. The record of Russian foreign policy in the Middle East and Ukraine—the two most recent manifestations of Moscow’s geopolitical ambitions—is a testament to the Kremlin’s effective use of those instruments. Russian foreign policy since the breakdown in relations with the West in 2014 suggests that Moscow is prepared to withstand and counter economic pressure and international political isolation in pursuit of its foreign policy objectives. Russia will not be deterred by sanctions, which have constituted the bulk of the West’s response to Moscow’s disruptive policy to date.
• As the confrontation with the West takes on a long-term, permanent character, neither Russian foreign policy nor the Kremlin’s toolkit will stay static. Moscow will continue to prioritize the creation of new capabilities that can protect the regime and advance the country’s national interests. Moscow has repeatedly demonstrated in recent years a knack for innovation and an ability to adapt to an ever-changing political, geopolitical, and technological environment.
The use of off-the-shelf social media technologies in order to advance Russia’s foreign policy objectives has been amply demonstrated in the U.S. presidential election in 2016, as well as in other situations since then. Technological breakthroughs—virtual reality and artificial intelligence, to name just two of the most frequently mentioned areas of progress—will undoubtedly be adopted by Russian state actors and their agents, adapted to their needs, and (if need be) weaponized for the ongoing confrontation with the West. These technologies may be new, and they hold out the possibility of expanding and enriching the arsenal of Russian foreign policy. Yet Moscow’s driving ambitions, as well as the many other tools in that arsenal, will continue to carry a lasting imprint of Soviet foreign policy.

ABSTRACT
This article evaluates the influence of the Azerbaijan crisis of 1945–46 on evolving perceptions of the Soviet Union within the British Foreign Office. Utilising records from the National Archives and personal papers, it synthesises the history of the Azerbaijan crisis with studies of Britain’s changing Soviet policy, previously focused solely on the Northern Department and Moscow representative Frank Roberts. In so doing, the paper provides an original diplomatic history which argues that, although Europe remained the strategic priority for Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, Iranian developments were of greater significance in prompting a perceptual transition from cooperation to Cold War confrontation.
The first major crisis of the Cold War erupted in Iranian Azerbaijan in December 1945. Hitherto, its role in the transformation of British perceptions of the Soviet Union has not been directly scrutinised. Yet the Azerbaijan crisis proved vital in establishing a ‘Cold War’ consensus within the Foreign Office. Acting in unison, advisors from the Northern and Eastern Departments successfully persuaded Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin to sanction limited anti-communist propaganda measures which constituted the first step in Bevin’s move from a policy of cautious cooperation to steadfast confrontation with the Soviets.
This problem of perceptions is crucial to understanding the origins of a Cold War mentality in British officialdom. During debates surrounding Soviet intransigence in Germany and Eastern Europe, in addition to the more volatile crises in the Near East, Foreign Office experts began a fundamental re-evaluation of Soviet intentions and capabilities from spring 1946. Many of these diplomatic advisers had extensive experience in regional affairs; the head of the Eastern Department, Charles Baxter, for example, incumbent since 1938.
Most famously, the Chargé d’Affaires in Moscow, Frank Roberts, sent a series of dispatches in March 1946 similar to the ‘Long Telegram’ of his United States counterpart, George F. Kennan. Meanwhile, Russian experts in the Foreign Office such as outgoing Northern Department chief Christopher Warner were coming to similar conclusions about the aggressive nature of Soviet policy.

Although Soviet interest in the country occupying their southern border was of little surprise to these officials, they increasingly conceptualised Soviet aims in Iran as less security-oriented and more expansionist, reflecting traditional Tsarist policies: an analogy implicit in the recurrent misuse of the term ‘Russia’, which further represented a denial of legitimacy. Also reflecting a neo-imperialist world-view, British officials continued to refer to Iran as Persia despite a formal name-change in 1935.
This article evaluates decision-making within the Foreign Office, focusing on the three personalities of Sir Reader Bullard (ambassador to Iran), Frank Roberts, and Bevin using official correspondence in addition to personal papers and memoirs. This new interpretation highlights the significance of the Azerbaijan crisis in the adoption of a Cold War mentality in British Soviet Policy. This was a two-stage process. Firstly, events in Iran prompted perceptual changes by Whitehall officials, creating a growing climate of opinion in favour of counter-measures. Subsequently, these ideas were gradually adopted by Bevin and translated into official policy.
The Azerbaijan crisis, Cold War historians and British policy
The Azerbaijan crisis resulted from latent tensions ongoing since Britain and the Soviet Union occupied and divided Iran in August 1941. United by wartime necessity, the occupation began smoothly, but by autumn 1944 divisions were apparent over bids by the Great Powers for oil concessions. Due to Iranian resolution, these oil bids were forestalled, but Soviet action in instigating a propaganda war of nerves through the Tudeh, the Iranian Communist Party, foreshadowed future events. Only the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC, founded 1908) maintained an oil concession in Iran.
In September 1945, at Soviet instigation, an Azerbaijan Democratic Party (ADP) was formed in the northern occupation zone. By 15 December, the ADP had established a government in the provincial capital, Tabriz, and pronounced its autonomy. An Iranian complaint over Soviet behaviour at the first meeting of the United Nations Organisation (UNO) failed to resolve the controversy, which only escalated following the failure of the Red Army to remove its occupation forces by the agreed deadline of 2 March 1946. The ensuing second round of UNO debates were followed by a bilateral Soviet-Iranian oil deal on 4 April 1946. The present article synthesises this history of the Azerbaijan crisis with the development of a Cold War mentality within the Foreign Office, assessing the crucial role played by developments in Azerbaijan in convincing British officials of the need to adopt a more assertive policy vis-à-vis Moscow.
The influence of anti-Soviet perceptions upon adopted British policy has been scrutinised by historians, predominantly from the first wave of a ‘British school’ on the origins of the Cold War. Raymond Smith and Sean Greenwood both assert that Frank Roberts had a lesser policy impact than Kennan because officials back in London independently reached similar conclusions. Nevertheless, Greenwood accepts that Roberts nevertheless had a discernible impact upon Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin’s decision to take a tougher stand over Germany from summer 1946.1

COLD WAR HISTORY ﻿  281
This alludes to an area of controversy regarding the chronology of the adoption of anti-Soviet policies by Bevin. His biographer, Alan Bullock, has suggested that, although still reluctant to break off cooperation in Europe, Bevin adopted a harder-line position in the early stages of the Azerbaijan crisis. Yet in May 1946, the foreign secretary sent incoming Ambassador Maurice Peterson to Moscow with the offer of a 50 year alliance: suggestive of a residual commitment to cooperation.2 The appointment of Peterson provides interesting insight into the expertise of Bevin’s advisers. Although lacking any direct Soviet experience, Peterson had served in Franco’s Spain, thus becoming accustomed to dealing with dictators, and most recently as ambassador to Turkey where he gained a reputation for standing firm against the Soviet ‘war of nerves’.3 Therefore Peterson’s selection for Moscow could also be indicative of Bevin’s desire to adopt a firmer line with the Kremlin.
The article concludes that Bevin was initially less hard-line in the Near East than has been suggested: closer to his own European attitude or the more internationalist position of Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Lacking foreign policy experience, Bevin was assumed by his officials to be malleable. This assumption was partly justified, as Bevin proved willing to follow the advice of the hard-line lobby as the Iran crisis dragged on. But as demonstrated by historians including Raymond Smith and Ray Merrick, Bevin resisted the expansion of propaganda policies advocated by the Foreign Office until October 1946.4 Ultimately, Bevin’s personal agency was decisive in applying his own experience during the Azerbaijan crisis to broader Soviet policy.
This existing historiography has not adequately explored the significance of Iran in driving these Foreign Office re-evaluations. It would be erroneous to assert that Iran was a greater priority for the Foreign Office than Europe. Prime Minister Attlee asserted unequivocally that ‘Europe came first. In the order of priority of world strategy that was Number One. From our point of view the Middle East was Number Two’.5 However, events in Azerbaijan provided far stronger evidence of Soviet perfidy, and ultimately Iran proved the testing ground for a confrontation strategy only later exported to Europe.
Therefore, to properly understand the shift from cooperation to confrontation in Foreign Office Soviet policy, the Iranian factor requires greater attention. This discussion analyses the impact of events in Iran through the perspective of specific diplomats in the two departments most significant in the formulation of anti-Soviet policy: the Eastern and Northern Departments. The former, responsible for British involvement in the Middle East, moved from an attitude of cooperation to confrontation before the Northern Department, despite the latter’s responsibility for Anglo-Soviet relations. In particular, Sir Reader Bullard, minister (subsequently upgraded to ambassador) to Iran since 1939, played a vital role in

cementing the Eastern Department as an anti-Soviet lobby, influenced by his experiences since the Anglo-Soviet occupation of August 1941.
In so doing, the article adheres to John Kent’s principle that ‘defining a single Foreign Office position on interdepartmental questions of high policy… is an impossible task’.6 Instead, it is necessary to critically evaluate the relationship between perceptions and policy with reference to bureaucratic decision-making over the Near East.
The construction of what the Foreign Office understood as the Near East remains a subject of intense controversy, inherently linked to Great Power interests.7 For the sake of clarity, this discussion takes its lead from the British Air Officer Commanding Iraq and Iran during 1945–46. In a lecture of 1954, Air Marshal Strafford explained that the region of Iran, Iraq, Turkey and perhaps Greece, synonymous with the American concept of the Northern Tier in the 1950s, constituted the Near East. The Middle East can therefore be understood as the larger region from Libya in the west to Afghanistan in the east, which in terms of broader policy questions also incorporated the Near East.8
Sir Reader Bullard and the Eastern Department
Sir Reader Bullard’s world-view was heavily conditioned by his prior experience. His first significant Foreign Office posting was as consul-general to Stalin’s Soviet Union in 1930–34: a period which saw a dramatic breach in relations due to the Metro-Vickers spy scandal. Subsequently, Bullard served as ambassador to Saudi Arabia until 1939, leaving him frustrated with the difficulties in doing business with an unashamedly pro-American Arab state.9 Throughout these postings and his tenure in Iran, 1939–46, Bullard was deprived of seeing his family for most of 16 years, with the exception of irregular home leave to Oxford. Although absent from his wife Miriam for vast periods, Bullard wrote to her regularly describing in great detail political and diplomatic developments, revealing his personal transformation from an attitude of cooperation to confrontation. It is little wonder that Frank Roberts described him as both an ‘acknowledged expert’ on the Middle East, and decidedly ‘long-suffering’.10
Further, and unsurprisingly, Bullard’s experience left him equally disillusioned in dealing with both the Iranians and the Soviets. With regards to the former, he exhibited an Orientalist attitude that Iranians simply lacked the capacity for responsible self-government, comparing them to Indians: a people in the colonial stage of development.11
Of greater interest are Bullard’s attitudes towards the Soviet Union. In his memoirs, the ambassador described himself as one of the earliest ‘cold warriors’, confronting Soviet

infringements on Iranian sovereignty including an oil-inspired war of nerves in October 1944. Unlike similar aggrandisements made in President Truman’s memoirs, Bullard’s self-assertions bear greater scrutiny.12
Following the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in August 1941, Bullard’s personal letters reveal initial surprise at the cordiality of working relations with his Soviet counterpart. Bullard wrote that ‘I never expected to be engaged in an entente cordiale with a Soviet colleague. Fortunately he is the best Soviet representative I ever saw… He is also a good man to work with. This is lucky, as I have a great deal to do with him.’13 This surprising cooperation deteriorated at the Tehran conference in December 1943, when Bullard complained that the Soviets were already abrogating the 1942 Tripartite Treaty regulating the occupation regime. Specifically, Bullard griped at Soviet propaganda attempts to appear the chief supporter of the conference Declaration on Iran, despite already breaking its principles through actions in the north including stockpiling food supplies and putting Soviet national interest before sensitivity to the local population.14
Bullard’s relapse into suspicion of Soviet intentions was further accelerated following pressures for an oil concession in October 1944, when he personally took action against Soviet propaganda initiatives. Following this experience, the long-suffering ambassador lamented that ‘one of the things that one learns from contact with the Russians is that reciprocity does not mean to them what it does to us.’15 This remark is noteworthy because this concept of ‘reciprocity’ would prove one of the key tenets of the recommendations by Frank Roberts in March 1946. With regards to Bullard’s perceptions, this pessimistic attitude is starkly removed from his initially cordial relations. Thus it appears that, with regards to the individual diplomatic experience, Anglo-Soviet relations deteriorated much faster in the Near East than in Europe.
By autumn 1945, whilst Soviet authorities engineered the creation of the ADP in Tabriz, Bullard’s private opinions had already hardened into a confrontation mentality. Referring to Soviet prevention of Iranian army entry into Azerbaijan in November 1945, he complained that:
Is it unfair to suggest that (to put it mildly) nothing is being done in the north to ensure a peaceful transfer from Russian to Persian authority when the Russians evacuate... ? [Nor] why the Soviets should paint red stars on the hundreds of stones that mark the edge of the ravine on Tabriz road.16
This unsigned note, believed to be a personal aide-memoire by the ambassador, is indicative of stronger objections than Bullard’s earlier complaints about the lack of reciprocity in diplomatic relations. Rather, the ambassador appears to be highly suspicious of direct Soviet meddling, emphasising the use of ideological symbolism endemic to Cold War attitudes.
Personally convinced of the need for a tougher policy, Bullard attempted to influence Bevin into accepting this Cold War mentality. Most notably, on 18 December 1945, the forthright ambassador was in Moscow to advise Bevin during the Allied Council of Foreign

Ministers meeting. His presence alone is testimony to the importance attached to disagreements in Iran, following the outbreak of the Azerbaijan crisis a few days earlier. Whilst in Moscow, Bullard authored a briefing for the foreign secretary outlining his perception of Soviet intentions:
Azerbaijan is not being annexed to Russia… because the nominal retention of Azerbaijan in the Persian state will make it the pace-maker for the whole country. By this means the Russians may hope to gain control of the Central Government and therefore of British oil interests in the south.17
Subsequently, he turned to the problem created by Soviet support for Kurdish autonomy, with transnational implications for Iraq and Kuwait:
The Kurdish areas in Iraq include the Iraqi oilfields, which are mainly British but partly an American interest. If Iraq loses her oil she will be a bankrupt state and fall all the more easily into the Russian system. If Iraq goes, Kuwait will be in danger… and from Kuwait to the American oil interests in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain is only a step.18
From this statement of Soviet expansionist designs, Bullard’s attitudes had evidently hardened considerably following the outbreak of the Azerbaijan crisis. Soviet support for the Kurds arose concurrently with their creation of the ADP movement, encouraging the formation of an independent Kurdish Republic of Mahabad in north-western Iran. Together, these two territories gave Moscow control over one fifth of Iran’s industrial and agricultural production.
Later contacts between the United States Embassy in Tehran and Kurdish leaders suggested that the Kurds were at best lukewarm adherents to Soviet ideology. Although grateful for Soviet aid in shaking off the perceived tyranny of Tehran, one chieftain informed Gerald Dooher, American tribal expert and Tabriz consul, that he was suspicious of the anti-feudal implications communism would have on his society, and disgruntled at being forced to watch a turgid film on the 1917 revolution by Soviet propagandists.19 As Bullard himself quipped, it was no accident that the VOKS, the Soviet ‘House of Culture’, was known locally as the ‘House of Rudeness’ because of its unceasing, culturally offensive propaganda.20 Although it may appear that the likelihood of a transnational Kurdish communist revolution was unlikely given this disdain, Bullard’s suspicions regarding such a development illuminate the extent of Cold War paranoia already entering into his discourse.
On the surface, Bullard’s memorandum of 18 December can be interpreted as a remarkably prescient prediction of some of the key Western theories of ‘containment’. By linking economic dislocation with the spread of communism, Bullard foreshadowed the political rationale behind Marshal Aid, and in his description of the Kurdish problem, creates a form of oil-driven ‘domino principle’. Further, by emphasising British and United States ownership of Near Eastern oil, he provides some evidence to support a revisionist interpretation of the prominence of Western economic interests in the origins of the Cold War. Although these events preceded the entry of ‘containment’ into popular dialogue, the American historian Robert Pfau has already applied it retrospectively to the Iran crisis as evident in practice.

COLD WAR HISTORY ﻿  285
The same can be applied to Bullard’s perceptions of Soviet meddling and subsequent action taken by the Foreign Office.21
Similar sentiments were apparent in other officials connected to Iran, including Air Marshal S. C. Strafford, commander of RAF Iraq and Persia during the phasing out of that command in 1945–46. Strafford, a man whose scrap-books reveal interests spanning the great commanders Marlborough and Napoleon to the American Wild West, warned as early as July 1945 that ‘Russian interest in Persia continues to grow in a way which too often appears more possessive than paternal’.22 As well as supporting the conclusion of certain historians that the British military were quicker to suspect Soviet motives than the Foreign Office, this comment also indicates a Near Eastern factor in driving disillusionment.23 Reflecting Bullard’s concerns, Strafford exhibited early suspicions of Soviet good faith regarding the Iranian occupation agreement.
Back in Britain, the press was not immune from scare-mongering over Iran. Echoing Bullard’s ‘domino’ concerns, The Times wrote that ‘the autonomy of Azerbaijan would have been a matter of secondary importance had it not been for the fact that Soviet influence… will now spread as far as the shores of Lake Urmia, a strategic position commanding the approaches to the eastern frontier of Turkey and also leading towards southern Persia, Iraq, and the oilfields region’.24 This newspaper commentary and Bullard’s messages imply that the oil factor was a major motivation in British calculations.
But these warnings of the incompatibility of British and Soviet interests had little immediate impact on official policy. At the Moscow Conference, Bevin remained committed to resolving the Azerbaijan crisis through negotiations, even persuading Bullard to oppose the Iranian desire to raise a complaint at the UNO in favour of an Anglo-Soviet-Iranian Tripartite Commission on Azerbaijani autonomy.25 Therefore, from the perspective of Bullard’s influence, the Iran crisis would appear to support the prevailing interpretation that Bevin proved resistant to the unambiguous warnings of his experts. Bullard supported the Commission for different reasons: namely to maintain traditional Great Power balance in Iran.
Instead, Bevin’s policy was dictated less by anti-communist ‘containment’ concerns than interest in the authority of the UNO. For example, passing instructions in March 1946 to Alexander Cadogan, the British representative on the Security Council, Bevin authorised pressure to obtain an immediate resolution calling on the Soviets to withdraw. He continued to list the numerous accords broken by Moscow’s actions in Azerbaijan: the 1942 Tripartite Treaty, 1943 Tehran Declaration, 1945 Potsdam Agreement and Molotov’s verbal assurances at the London and Moscow conferences.26
This catalogue is illuminating of Bevin’s legalistic approach to the Azerbaijan crisis, focusing on Soviet breach of faith rather than oil or geopolitical interests which preoccupied Bullard. The origins of this approach, distinct from the Cold War concerns accepted by the Eastern Department, can be found within Bevin’s hopes for a new Middle Eastern policy compatible with the national agenda of the Labour Government.

Department officials, the foreign secretary’s priority was less the assertion of British influence against Soviet encroachments than restructuring regional partnerships ‘on the basis of a free and equal relationship’.27
Nevertheless, to borrow words from the historian Raymond Smith, Bullard’s views were significant in the creation of an increasingly pessimistic ‘climate of opinion’ within the Foreign Office.28 The Eastern Department received an escalating quantity of warning to the same effect concerning Moscow’s expansionist intentions. To illustrate, an Iranian Member of Parliament, Dr Abdoh, sent a message via a British army officer, theorising that the Soviet Union was trying to extend its ‘security cordon’ from Eastern Europe to the Near East by facilitating the rise of friendly governments in Iran and Turkey.29 With fewer relevant credentials to lend significance to his argument, one ‘eminent ecclesiastic’ in the Vatican warned that ‘communism was no longer the inspiration of Russian policy but a valuable instrument of Russian imperialism’.30 The content of this message foreshadows the analysis of the origins of Soviet foreign policy by Frank Roberts. Indeed, the similarity between the opinions of all the analysts discussed herein is striking.
The Eastern Department collated and evaluated all these messages, their content having some impact on the hard-line attitudes of members such as Iranian desk officer Lancelot Pyman during subsequent policy debates. Marginal notes from officials including Pyman and experienced departmental chief Charles Baxter show agreement with the opinion of Bullard’s Tabriz representative that Moscow had moved beyond desiring a friendly independent regime in Iran to plans to turn Iran into a fully subservient Outer Mongolia-style satellite.31 This clearly accords with the ‘domino’ views expressed by Bullard himself and also Air Marshal Strafford’s accusation of the shift in Soviet thinking from paternalistic to possessive intentions.
It is interesting that declassified Soviet documents vindicate Bullard’s theories. In a letter to disappointed ADP leader Pishevari following the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Stalin justified his betrayal by reminding Pishevari that the Soviet Union was following a global strategy. Furthermore, dividing Qavam from the British would enable Stalin to extract concessions from the former whilst isolating the latter, ‘creat[ing] some basis for the further democratisation of Iran’.32 Given that Stalin’s definition of ‘democratisation’ entailed ‘communisation’, this strongly echoes Bullard’s memorandum to Bevin, suggesting that the Cold War in the Near East was fuelled not by misperceptions but accurate understandings of Stalin’s goals.

Bullard’s forthright reporting was instrumental in cementing a Cold War attitude within the Eastern Department. But more significant in terms of the wider adoption of a ‘containment’ policy were the prescriptions of Frank Roberts, chargé d’affaires in Moscow and embassy

chief due to the absence of an ambassador in March 1946. Born in Buenos Aires, Roberts joined the Foreign Office in 1930, assigned to the Northern Department before a quick transfer to the China desk because of his inability to speak Russian: a skill, in fact, which he was strongly dissuaded from pursuing.33
Posted to Moscow in 1945, Roberts underwent a more rapid perceptual transformation than Bullard. Initially, his opinions corresponded to the dominant Foreign Office feeling that Soviet goals were based on legitimate security concerns. Even whilst noting that Soviet policy was becoming increasingly difficult in the Near East, Roberts attributed this not to sinister motives but ‘a vicious circle of suspicions and counter-suspicions’ of the sort discussed by John Lewis Gaddis in his post-revisionist history.34
In contrast, back in the Foreign Office, long-standing Soviet-hater Orme Sargent was advising a different approach: the creation of a ‘Monroe’ system of British influence in the Near East to limit Soviet expansionism.35 Sargent, who had previously opposed the appeasement of Hitler’s Germany, spent the Second World War worrying about Soviet influence. In November 1940 he proposed taking over the Anti-Comintern Pact to attract Spain, Italy and Japan to Britain’s cause; later, he maintained the need for a balance of power in Europe and tight Anglo-French control of defeated Germany to prevent Soviet expansion.36 Thus Sargent’s contribution to the Azerbaijan crisis was not a radical conversion, but rather a repetition of his wartime proscriptions for a realist approach in countering Stalin’s ambitions.
Similar to Bullard’s prescriptions, Sargent’s emphasis on the need to defend British strategic and economic interests are suggestive of an advanced anti-Soviet policy bearing strong resemblance to later understandings of ‘containment’. Holding the position of permanent under-secretary, Sargent possessed considerable influence within the professional Foreign Office, but was constrained by the foreign secretary’s direction. In assessing Soviet intentions in Iran, both Bullard and Sargent emphasised traditional Great Power ambitions over ideological zeal, thus favouring counter-measures based upon the balance of power and strengthened British influence. This contrasted with Bevin’s agenda for a new Middle Eastern policy of partnership and equality.
As the Azerbaijan crisis escalated, these opinions hardened. On 5 January 1946, Roberts appeared to accept Bullard’s ‘domino’ rationale in his sympathies with a demarche from the Afghan representative in Moscow calling on Britain to lead Near Eastern nations in resisting Soviet pressures. The Afghan ambassador warned that ‘Azerbaijan was a test-case and if Soviet infiltration tactics succeeded there, similar methods would be used against first Turkey and then Afghanistan’. Although Roberts agreed with this appreciation, he advised Bevin against embarking on a ‘tug-of-war’ with Moscow for influence in the Near East, at this point still sharing Bevin’s preference for a solution through the UNO.37 However, by March, his optimism for an amicable solution had dissipated. This can be attributed to the experience of the visit to Moscow of Iranian Prime Minister Ahmad Qavam for talks with Stalin.

In his memoirs, Roberts credited the septuagenarian Qavam with being the prime mover behind the resolution of the Azerbaijan crisis, and recalled becoming a frequent confidant of the ailing statesmen during the Moscow talks.38 During Qavam’s expedition to Moscow in February-March 1946, both Roberts and George F. Kennan received pleas for support from the Iranian premier. Although the Eastern Department dismissed Qavam as a Soviet stooge, having replaced the more independent Ibrahim Hakimi due to Soviet pressure on 21 January, Roberts experienced a different side to Qavam. He encountered a desperate, nationalist statesman reduced to appealing for help to one imperialist power in order to fend off pressures from another. However, due to the tone of policy set by Bevin, Roberts could only offer vague sympathy with polite refusals, emphasising that Britain and the United States could only help if Tehran took the lead in confronting Soviet infringements at the UNO.39
Witnessing Soviet intransigence first-hand in the face of Qavam’s reasonable offers, Roberts suggested to Bevin that ‘the Soviet authorities will hardly be deterred from achieving their ends in North Persia by fear of unpleasant consequences in [the] United Nations Organisation’. By mid-March 1946, at the height of the Azerbaijan crisis, the Moscow representative was convinced that Stalin intended to extort agreement with Qavam on Azerbaijan and an oil concession by threats or even force if required. Roberts suggested making a firm public statement of support for Qavam, refusing to recognise any agreement reached under duress, but as with Bullard’s concerns, this was not followed through.40
Roberts’ preoccupation with events in Iran has been overlooked by previous historians, but it provides an explanation for the convergence of views between himself and the Eastern Department. In the first of his famous Moscow despatches of March 1946, he drew attention to Soviet success in the Moscow Conference: achieving its aims in South-Eastern Europe whilst deflecting Western complaints regarding the Near East. Roberts cited Soviet pressure on Iran and Turkey as signs that earlier propaganda offensives were becoming more proactive policies. He attributed this not to opportunism against British weakness but fears over a resurgence of British imperial strength, thus trying to take quick advantage of the fluid post-war situation.41
In further telegrams, Roberts expanded on this exposition of Soviet action with reference to the origins of Soviet foreign policy. He postulated both continuity with Imperial Russian goals and the influence of ideological prescriptions which the Kremlin leaders genuinely believed, starved from competing interpretations. Consequently, the Soviet conception of security guarantees was constantly expanding: Azerbaijan was required to protect the oilfields of Baku, but this logically required central and southern Iran to be added as buffers for Azerbaijan. As a result, based specifically upon the Iranian example, Roberts concluded that ‘Soviet security has become hard to distinguish from Soviet imperialism and it is becoming uncertain whether there is in fact any limit to Soviet expansion’.42
Expanding further upon these Near Eastern concerns, Roberts described Soviet intentions as derived equally from the desire for a security belt and historic Russian

ambitions. Relating to the oil problem which had greatly facilitated Bullard’s break with his Soviet counterparts in 1944, Roberts predicted that Soviet domestic production was no longer sufficient for their needs, rendering the AIOC oilfields in southern Iran a tempting target. Mirroring Bullard’s bleak ‘domino’ warnings, the Moscow representative surmised that the Soviet campaign would be an escalating long-term strategy: ‘the Soviet Union approaches the Middle East as an artichoke whose leaves are to be eaten one by one.’43
Consequently, Frank Roberts was strongly influenced in his estimation of Soviet foreign policy by the development of events in Iran. Due to his relationship with Qavam during the Iranian premier’s visit to Moscow, as well as his activity in collating Soviet press statements to forecast their intentions, this concern was derived from personal experience.44 Initially, Roberts agreed with Bevin’s preference for a more internationalist solution, but through familiarity with the Stalinist system he became converted to the harder-line lobby of Bullard and Sargent.
Over a year later, Roberts reflected that, despite his earlier conclusions, the Soviet Union had no genuine economic need for Iranian oil. Therefore, their primary motivation in negotiating the April 1946 Qavam-Sadchikov oil agreement at the end of the Azerbaijan crisis was entirely political and strategic. Whilst their first priority was probably to establish a ‘protective belt’, typified by Soviet intervention in Azerbaijan, the historic ambitions of tsarist Russia to reach the warm waters of the Persian Gulf (a commanding strategic position on the approach to India) could not be discounted.45
In early 1946, both Bullard and Roberts were ideally placed to witness developing Soviet propaganda against British influence in Iran. In addition, Soviet actions during the Azerbaijan crisis constituted clearer evidence of Soviet perfidy in breaching wartime agreements than developments in Europe, which were more open to interpretation due to the conflict between agreements such as the Potsdam Accords and Churchill-Stalin ‘percentages’ deal. The Iran crisis brought the wartime allies to discord during the first session of the UNO, whilst Bevin and his American counterpart, James F. Byrnes, still hoped for cooperation in Europe. Therefore it is only natural that the Near East loomed large in Roberts’ calculations. What is more surprising is its relative omission from the Kennan Long Telegram, although this is explicable by the less specific character of Kennan’s analysis.46
If Bullard’s views can be said to have been warmly received by the Eastern Department, then Roberts equally played a role in realigning Cold War perceptions within the Northern Department. Whilst officials such as Northern Department chief Christopher Warner reached simultaneous conclusions based on independent analysis, Roberts played a useful role, as did Kennan for the United States, in focusing these changing perceptions of Soviet intentions through his series of unambiguous telegrams. This provided the impetus to stimulate further discussion in the Foreign Office, in turn leading to the promulgation of a Russia Committee to coordinate Soviet policy and consideration of an anti-Soviet propaganda drive.

Ernest Bevin and British policy: propaganda and Middle Eastern defence
However, as numerous historians have attested, despite accord between Roberts and Warner on the need for a ‘defensive-offensive’ propaganda policy, this was prevented by Bevin’s reluctance to accept a break in cooperation.47 These disagreements were a direct reflection of debates between the tougher Foreign Office line and the Bevin-Attlee position on the acceptance of Cold War logic. Further supporting the importance of the Near East in driving Foreign Office re-evaluations of Soviet policy, events in Iran proved the determining factor in Bevin’s acceptance of his advisors’ prescriptions. By the end of 1946, Bevin shared the harder-line Foreign Office understanding of the Cold War in the Near East, forcefully opposing the prime minister’s intention to withdraw from Britain’s position of influence and seek agreement with Stalin.
From April-May 1946, concerned officials led by Middle Eastern Under-Secretary Robert Howe considered using Soviet-style tactics to preserve British influence in Iran. These included stirring up separatist sentiments in the area of the AIOC concession: both putting pressure on Tehran and cultivating local clients. This was explicitly supported by Orme Sargent and garnered the sympathy of Eastern Department experts such as Howe and Iranian desk officer Pyman. However, Bevin vetoed any interference in Iranian domestic affairs due to his preoccupation with international principles.48 Yet although this policy at times prevented Bevin from adopting a stronger ‘containment’ line over Iran, it also helps explain his growing personal disillusionment with the Soviet Union. The Azerbaijan crisis proved beyond doubt that Stalin did not share Bevin’s respect for the sovereignty of small nations, and thus provided the context for the foreign secretary’s move towards an anti-communist policy before more familiar developments in Europe.
Ivone Kirkpatrick, propaganda expert on the new Russia Committee established following Northern Department pressure in April 1946, was dismayed by the foreign secretary’s reaction to his far-reaching proposals. Bevin agreed with Attlee to focus on positive publicity about Britain and the discrediting of communist ideology rather than Kirkpatrick’s scheme for attacks on Soviet foreign policy.49 Other Foreign Office hard-liners despaired vocally. Middle Eastern supremo Howe emphasised the need for a ‘full-blown effort’ in Iran, and Sargent feared that Bevin did not grasp the gravity of the situation in which Britain’s friends abroad were risking their political lives in standing up to Soviet penetration.50
The growing call for assertive propaganda reveals a convergence of views between the Eastern and Northern Departments. Maurice Peterson, recently appointed ambassador to Moscow from his previous Near Eastern vantage point in Ankara, encapsulates this growing trend for inter-departmental accord. From Moscow, Peterson elaborated further on Roberts’ depictions of Soviet intentions. He explained that Stalin’s initial post-war aims of establishing a precautionary buffer zone immediately around his borders, including Azerbaijan, had given way to more ambitious goals of rendering the entirety of Iran a satellite. Like the Northern and Eastern Departments back in London, Peterson envisaged a propaganda campaign to attack Soviet policy as the best means of safeguarding British influence.51 This

corresponds directly to the pressures embodied by Bullard, Roberts and figures such as Sargent: a growing climate of opinion behind the scenes of British officialdom.
Whilst Bevin commented on the proposed scheme that ‘the more I study it the less I like it’, he reluctantly agreed at the end of May 1946 to sanction a more aggressive propaganda campaign in Iran.52 This represents the first significant, albeit reluctant, concession from Bevin to the convinced Cold War lobby, prefiguring his conversion by the end of the year.
In addition to Foreign Office advice, Bevin’s steadfast support for Iranian sovereignty propelled him into adopting limited ‘containment’ action. This was conditioned by his own experience in the Azerbaijan crisis in vigorously opposing the Soviets through the framework of the February-March 1946 UNO debates. On 2 April, Bevin claimed with some credibility that ‘up to now we have borne the main burden of resisting Russian penetration of Persia’.53 This comment is suggestive of the foreign secretary’s own transition to a more confrontational attitude because of his frustration at the Soviet’s breach of faith in the UNO, fusing his internationalist concerns with Cold War realism. The UNO experience reinforced Bevin’s predisposition to mistrust communists, derived from his formative political experience as a trade union leader and wartime minister of labour, to which the foreign secretary harked back regularly.54
The fact that this propaganda campaign was initially authorised only in Iran highlights the significance of the Azerbaijan crisis in building a Cold War consensus. Outside the Eastern and Northern Departments, other officials remained reluctant to accept the Cold War as a fact of life. The head of the United Nations Department opposed Bevin’s own desire to maintain diplomatic pressure on the Soviet Union, instead arguing that ‘our initiative would fan the embers into a good old blaze’.55 Yet for the Eastern and Northern experts, it was clear that there already existed a ‘good old blaze’ which required immediate containing.
The first active measure in the propaganda programme which Bevin reluctantly authorised in May 1946 was the appointment of an India Office propaganda expert, Colonel Geoffrey Wheeler, as press officer in Tehran. Highlighting his dissatisfaction with having his hands tied by Bevin’s reservations about offensive propaganda, Wheeler expounded that ‘I am no more in favour of using half measures in publicity than of pitting Brown Bess against dive bombers’.56
Wheeler’s appointment was a significant concession to Eastern Department pressures. Bullard’s successor of April 1946, John Le Rougetel, strongly pressed Bevin for further action on the propaganda front. On 17 June, transmitting examples of the vitriolic attacks on Britain in the Soviet-sponsored Iranian press, including denunciations of the AIOC, he pleaded that ‘before long we may be authorised to open up with a broad-side’.57 Furthermore, Robert Howe also contributed to this climate of opinion with a memorandum outlining the need for more aggressive political warfare to detach members from puppet parties such as the Tudeh, and even to influence Qavam’s personal line against conciliation.58

Ahead of the Iranian general elections in January 1947, viewed by the Eastern Department as crucial to preventing a communist take-over, Wheeler proposed circulating the Canadian report on the Gouzenko spy scandal. This case, exposing the system of Soviet espionage operating from their Ottawa Embassy, would sow distrust between the Iranians and Soviet diplomatic community in Tehran.59
Incredibly, despite strong support from Eastern experts, the Northern Department, although containing such hard-liners as Warner and Roberts, voiced opposition. One official worried that publishing the Canadian report in Russian might be offensive to the Soviet Union.60 This starkly highlights the importance of Iran in the development of Cold War perceptions within the British decision-making establishment. Officials familiar with the reality in the Near East more readily treated the Cold War as unavoidable. This appears to be more than just a British peculiarity, as United States Near Eastern division chief Loy Henderson also recalled that his colleagues in the State Department Division of European Affairs and economic sections lacked strong convictions about resisting communism even after his own officials had become convinced of this necessity.61
Meeting Wheeler in March 1947, Robert Howe was briefed by the Eastern Department that the Colonel’s appointment had been a resounding success. Qavam was no longer considered a potential Soviet puppet; indeed, the more imminent danger was of popular Iranian opinion believing Qavam to be ‘our man’ due to his growing agreement with Britain’s anti-communist goals. Not all of Wheeler’s schemes had received approval, such as a plan to use his former India Office agents to spread subversive black propaganda, which was deemed too potentially embarrassing if leaked.62 This implies that the interaction between Foreign Office Cold War perceptions and Bevin’s international principles represented a two-way transfer, with officials increasingly sensitive to local and international opinion.
Pressures from Le Rougetel and other Eastern Department officials had a yet more significant impact in amending Bevin’s policy from autumn 1946. On 17 October, the Foreign Office circulated an agreed propaganda directive for the entire Middle East emphasising that propaganda would contain constructive publicity about British achievements and offensive propaganda against Moscow. The latter would consist of three prongs: exposing the realities of life in Russia, the nature of Soviet imperialism in the Near East, and emphasising British resolve in confronting this in Iran and Turkey. This represented an expansion of the programme sanctioned by Bevin in May 1946, no longer confined to Iran alone but instead applied to the entire region under Eastern Department responsibility. Secondly, the inclusion of offensive propaganda was a further concession to pressures embodied by Wheeler’s initial frustrations.63 The Eastern Department played a major role in the deliberations leading up to this policy, the importance of which is attested by the fact that Bevin still refused to sanction the expansion of this defensive-offensive principle to other regions, including Europe.64

COLD WAR HISTORY ﻿  293
Therefore, the climate of opinion in the Northern and Eastern Departments had proved highly influential upon Bevin’s foreign policy in two regards. Firstly, the experience of the Azerbaijan crisis persuaded Bevin to sanction propaganda measures which represented the earliest practical steps in his gradual adoption of a ‘containment’ mentality. Secondly, pressures from Bullard, Roberts and others combined with Bevin’s own interest in Britain’s guiding role in Middle Eastern affairs to ensure the foreign secretary became a firm advocate of the region’s importance.
By late 1946, the prime minister was increasingly worried about Britain’s defence commitments in the Middle East and Mediterranean. Attlee believed that the importance of the region was much reduced by recent advances in strategic bombing. Instead, he argued that the Middle East should be reduced to an outpost of a defence strategy focused on Central Africa. Furthermore, Attlee doubted whether Iran, Greece and Turkey could be rendered strong enough to be an effective barrier to Soviet expansionism. Going a step further, he even doubted the reality of the aggressive tendencies attributed to Stalin by Roberts and Bullard:
It is difficult to tell how far Russian policy is dictated by expansionism and how far by fear of attack by the US and ourselves. Fantastic as this is, it may very well be the real grounds of Russian policy. What we consider merely defence may seem to them to be preparations for an attack.65
In this vein, Attlee challenged the prevailing view in the Foreign Office and defence establishment regarding the strategic importance of states such as Iran as a buffer to Soviet expansion.
Attlee’s critique raised strong objections from one of Bevin’s closest advisors, his Principal Private Secretary Pierson Dixon. Dixon saw it as incontestable that what he termed the ‘points of friction’ countries (Iran, Turkey and Greece) were the very ‘nub’ of Anglo-Soviet relations: currently more important in the unveiling global contest than Europe. Reacting to Attlee’s proposal to reach an agreement with Stalin to make the Middle East a neutral zone, Dixon strongly dissuaded Bevin from supporting the prime minister. Withdrawing British forces and sacrificing British political influence in the Middle East would ‘bring Russian to the Congo and the Victoria Falls’. Whilst in the future a Central African defence strategy may be plausible, Dixon predicted that the Middle East would be vital for another ten to fifteen years. He further disputed the Prime Minister’s interpretation of Soviet defensive intentions, instead agreeing with Frank Roberts that what the Soviets called security was ‘almost indistinguishable from an imperialist instinct’.66
This strategic debate culminated in January 1947. Attlee attempted to garner Bevin’s sympathies in opposition to the views of the Chiefs of Staff. The Chiefs argued that the only way to prevent a fatal attack on the British homeland by long-range weapons was through threat of a counter-attack so formidable as to deter an enemy. Russia was the only plausible enemy, and the only bases from which Russia could be bombed were in the Middle East: specifically, Egypt, Palestine and Iraq. It is interesting that this deterrence argument greatly precedes the crises over Europe in 1948 and testing of a Soviet atomic bomb in August 1949.67
In contrast, Attlee continued to be motivated by anxieties regarding the cost and inefficiency of Middle Eastern defence. He dismissed the Chiefs of Staff position as a ‘strategy of despair’ which would tie Britain’s fortunes to the fates of what he termed a ‘congeries of

weak, backward and reactionary states’. In so doing, Britain would only exacerbate tensions, thus rendering a Soviet attack more likely.68
Bevin consulted Pierson Dixon before responding. Dixon’s arguments ultimately formed the exact template by which the foreign secretary replied, highlighting Bevin’s willingness to be guided by his officials. Dixon regarded Attlee’s plan for a Middle Eastern neutral zone as a new ‘Munich’ or an ‘Alice in Wonderland’ proposal. Bevin’s secretary wrote that ‘even if Russian world domination can be discounted [the] bear will certainly not resist pushing [its] paw into soft places’: places such as Iran and Turkey.69
Bevin championed Dixon’s arguments, representative of the Foreign Office climate of opinion, in his reply to Attlee on 9 January 1947. The plain-spoken foreign secretary argued that Attlee’s proposals were a reversal of the policy which Bevin had been pursuing in the Middle East since taking office. Bevin envisaged reformulating British leadership by encouraging economic development, nurturing political independence and coordinating the defence of the area not through large British troop deployments but by training local states. Repeating all of Dixon’s arguments, including the impact a surrender of the Middle East would have on the credibility of the UNO (particularly pertinent given the Security Council debates over Azerbaijan), Bevin convincingly discredited Attlee’s proposals. He further dismissed the prime minister’s optimistic appreciation of Stalin’s intentions, describing the Soviet leadership as bent on the creation of a communist world by infiltration if possible or war if necessary. In light of this depiction of Soviet policy, highly influenced by Roberts’ prescriptions and Dixon’s advice, Bevin concluded that ‘it would be as idle to place reliance on gaining our own security by large-scale one-sided concessions to Russia as it was with Hitler… it would be Munich over again, only on a world scale’.70
The new Bevin-Foreign Office position prevailed. Also on 9 January, Bevin, Attlee, and the minister of defence met to settle the strategic debate. It was agreed to continue with Bevin’s general policy, and that there would be no withdrawal of British forces beyond those already contemplated such as the large land forces in Iraq.71 This episode is revealing of the extent to which Bevin became influenced by the anti-Soviet lobby within the Foreign Office. Whilst in the propaganda debate he had appeared reluctant to sanction active measures against communism in Iran, just a few months later he was willing to follow his advisors’ suggestions without reservations.
In the arguments Dixon and Bevin employed, they depicted the Soviet Union as an inherently expansionist, untrustworthy enemy, strongly reflecting earlier assessments by Roberts. In his determination to resist Soviet domination of the Middle East, Bevin joined the ranks of Foreign Office officials such as Sargent and Bullard, albeit with one crucial difference. The foreign secretary remained committed to reforming British influence away from imperial domination towards more genuine partnerships. His solution for defending states including Iran was through assistance to local powers, not direct British intervention. Nevertheless, his passionate defence of Britain’s role as a regional leader is not dissimilar to Sargent’s vision of a British ‘Monroe Doctrine’.
Subsequent events shed further light on the influence of Iranian concerns in driving Bevin’s developing approach to the Soviet Union. From January 1947, tensions over Iran

centred on the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement signed by Qavam under duress in April 1946. At this new stage in the crisis over Azerbaijan, Bevin promised Stalin that Britain would not place obstacles in the way of the ratification of the accord. Nevertheless, this was a more cautious, realist-inspired position than his earlier internationalist stance. When Soviet diplomatic and intelligence officials approached the foreign secretary, Bevin balanced conciliation with firmness. Alongside his promise of non-interference, he warned Stalin’s messengers that Britain regarded the Near East as a vital defensive interest and would not tolerate oil concessions being used to undermine Iranian political independence.72
This informal statement of interest resembles earlier Foreign Office proposals for a declaration of support for Iran, reminding the Soviets that the Near East fell within Britain’s historic sphere of influence. Nevertheless, Bevin was hampered in 1947 by practical considerations which would not have applied in 1946. For example, following the granting of Indian independence and loss of the Indian Army, Britain no longer had the ability to despatch troops to southern Iran to directly protect their interests. Therefore, he had no choice but to balance firmness with conciliation.73 Bevin’s commitment to ‘containment’ was less universalist than that of the United States, derived from a realistic appreciation of Britain’s interests alongside its capacity to defend them. Due to the strategic importance of the Middle East and the AIOC concession, Iran was unequivocally one of those vital interests.
Consequently, the Azerbaijan crisis was of first importance in Bevin’s evolving Cold War strategy. At first reluctant to authorise action tantamount to ‘containment’, united pressure from the Eastern and Northern Departments ensured Bevin took the first step through the propaganda campaign in Iran, subsequently expanded to the entire Middle East. Meanwhile, the foreign secretary became a firm advocate of the strategic importance of retaining British regional influence, and from January 1947 adopted a balanced policy of firmness and conciliation to prevent Soviet expansion whilst not escalating tensions. Over the years 1947–48, this gradually developed into Bevin’s famous ‘containment’ programme typified by his attitude to Soviet infringements in Germany and support for Western European defence cooperation.
Conclusions
In February 1946, The Observer commented that ‘the “woe-woe” school of thought in this country sees in every increase of Russian influence in north Persia a diplomatic defeat for Britain’.74 In many ways this summary is correct, although pre-emptive in postulating a unified ‘woe-woe’ position at this juncture. In Iran, due to the oil imperative, traditional concerns about Soviet penetration, and growing worry regarding domestic communism, the Cold War was increasingly viewed in zero-sum terms.
This article has provided an original evaluation of the role of the Azerbaijan crisis in the development of Britain’s Cold War. By considering the evolution of Foreign Office perceptions of Soviet action, the significance of Iran in British political considerations becomes clearer. Officials with Near Eastern expertise were quicker to accept the end of Anglo-Soviet cooperation, and therefore constituted a hard-line climate of opinion. This position was

best typified by Reader Bullard’s warnings about the expansionist nature of Soviet foreign policy, seeking to render Iran a satellite within a broader global strategy.
Therefore, the Azerbaijan crisis played a vital role in driving Foreign Office re-evaluations of Soviet foreign policy intentions. Bullard’s personal letters prove that despite his previous experience in Moscow, he was initially optimistic regarding the occupation. However, reacting to specific Soviet infringements upon Iranian sovereignty, Bullard’s views steadily toughened. His briefing for Bevin in December 1945 encapsulates Bullard’s approach to the Cold War, emphasising the economic-strategic importance of British oil, and the unlimited nature of Soviet territorial designs in the Near East.
However, due to Bevin’s direction, these ideas had little practical influence. The foreign secretary was at first resistant to making a stand in Iran before his growing awareness of the strategic importance of the region combined with escalating pressure for a more affirmative stance. At most, Bullard was a significant player in generating these pressures by contributing to a climate of opinion within the Eastern Department, in addition to his assertive role within his own remit in Tehran.
Similarly, Frank Roberts moved from a position of cautious cooperation with the Soviet Union to advocating dealings based on firmness and reciprocity. This concept of reciprocity or quid pro quo diplomacy stemmed directly from his belief in the traditional undercurrent which complimented the ideological trimmings of Soviet foreign policy.75 Roberts’ individual perceptions were influenced by his own role in the Iran crisis, attested by his frequent citation of the Iranian example in his famous long despatches. But as with Bullard, the ideas he expressed in March 1946 did not immediately alter British policy. The greatest significance of these attitudes was in uniting the Eastern and Northern Departments into a lobby for tougher action, which Bevin was increasingly willing to adhere to as his own experience at the UNO provided corresponding proof of Soviet perfidy.
The propaganda debate demonstrates further the significance of Iran to the development of Bevin’s Cold War, with the foreign secretary first sanctioning a sustained offensive in Tehran. This is not to say that Britain’s Cold War began solely in Iran, as concurrent debates surrounding Germany and Eastern Europe were, outside the ranks of the Eastern Department, given first priority. But the Azerbaijan crisis was treated as more urgent by Bevin, and therefore served as a testing-ground for a ‘containment’ policy which would be later introduced in more strategically-vital areas. The foreign secretary also incorporated arguments from his harder-line advisers in convincing the Prime Minister of the strategic importance of the Middle East: applying perceptions of Soviet expansion derived from the Azerbaijan crisis to the more general problem of regional defence. Both in underpinning perceptive re-evaluations by providing the starkest evidence of Soviet perfidy, and in developing effective countermeasures, Iran achieved heightened significance in the development of both a Foreign Office anti-Soviet consensus and the emerging strong personal stance of Ernest Bevin.

Executive Summary
Since at least 2005, Russia’s leadership has believed itself to be at war with the West. This war is not primarily one of kinetic combat though recent moves suggest that Moscow believes such a war is increasingly conceivable. Rather it should be described as a new form of political warfare that derives in many from Soviet precedents.
Political warfare is a whole of government strategy where military forces play a vital but not necessarily primary role in the strategic rivalry with Washington. Their purpose is first to intimidate and then to deter the West, acquire a usable military superiority over neighbors and on Russia’s frontiers, and sustain the regime and its view of Russia as a great power that is under perpetual siege from abroad.
The strategy then is one of “cross-domain coercion” as coined by Dmitry Adamsky and it ranges globally. Even as Moscow builds up its conventional and nuclear weapons (despite economic constraints that have even forced reductions in defense outlays) from the Arctic to the Levant, it conducts an unrelenting asymmetric information and cyber warfare that targets key socio-political, infrastructural institutions and grids, uses energy, organized crime, media and intelligence subversion and subsidization of foreign politicians, movements and parties for its aims.
Since 2016, the West has begun to come to terms with this “phalanx” of forces but it is clear that much more has to be done for Russia enjoys conventional superiority in Europe along its frontiers, is conducting an unopposed information warfare and the non-kinetic domains of its strategy are operating uninterruptedly.
However, we cannot simply dismiss the military aspect given Russia’s problems and NATO’s superiority on paper. Even if Moscow prefers not to wage an actual war against the West, it continues military operations in Ukraine and Syria while threatening NATO members from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and by regularly making nuclear and conventional probes and overt threats. Recent trends show that the Russian government is deliberately fostering a domestic mobilization program and war psychosis against the West.
Therefore, it is essential that we grasp Moscow’s strategy and formulate an appropriately competitive one to negate its strengths and induce it to make strategic decisions that reduce its ability to mount successful challenges to the U.S. Apart from the incessant information and political warfare campaign, Moscow’s nuclear buildup, which now includes both countervalue and counterforce weapons, aims not to escalate to deescalate in wartime but rather at a much broader concept.
This concept is escalation control, namely the ability to control all the phases and potentials for escalation throughout any crisis from start to finish. In achieving this outcome Moscow will both intimidate and deter NATO into accepting Russian faits accomplis, e.g. Crimea or Syria. In this way Moscow can exercise untrammeled sway over the former Soviet space and convince itself, its subjects, and the rest of the world that Russia is truly the great power it conceives itself to be.
In that case the U.S. and its allies will then have to treat it as an equal, essentially allowing it veto over U.S. and NATO military actions, and acknowledging it as having an unquestioned sphere of
1

influence in Eastern Europe, i.e. not only the former Soviet Union but even the Warsaw Pact territories. At the geopolitical level this is a strategy of inciting and exploiting every conceivable source of division in world politics, engendering an arms race that Russia thinks had already begun against it, and extending its claim to strategic real estate from the Arctic to the Mediterranean and global influence beyond those parameters.
This strategy also dictates the necessity of not just friendship with China but arguably of an alliance to force the West into accepting Russia’s self-valuation and claims. This is not a formal alliance like NATO but the two powers share common frameworks of self-representation, a common animus towards U.S. values and power, and a desire to rewrite the rules and territorial parameters of the current international order to reflect more accurately what they believe is their rising and our declining power.
Russia, in response to its transformed strategic environment, capabilities, and understanding of contemporary war, has long since formulated and begun to execute a strategy that challenges the U.S. across multiple domains and territories from the Arctic even to South America, e.g. its position in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua.
At the same time, Russia is also cementing a multi-dimensional alliance with China and threatening an offensive military and nuclear strategy. The persistence of this strategy and its refinement over a decade of policy requires that we too recognize that we are under attack and will be for some time to come. Therefore the West must formulate and execute our own equally competitive strategy.
We are confronted by a Russian adversary not only in possession of new weapons but also with new tactics and innovative thinking about contemporary warfare. Therefore we must also disenthrall ourselves and think anew about that subject. This requires more than new, advanced weapons as promised by the third offset strategy.
Europe is under attack whether it accepts it or not. And Putin’s Russia is an implacable foe, i.e. one that cannot be placated, for it will regard dialogue as surrender and proof of its allegations concerning the West’s lack of moral fiber. Moreover, war is inherent in Putin’s project as is empire. And if we are at war a strategic response is necessary that utilizes all the instruments of power and deploys them wisely
Therefore business as usual, as many recommend, is not an adequate reaction to our unexpected situation. Strategy, operations, force structures, tactics, and not least operational and strategic concepts as well as intelligence must be upgraded and adapted to contemporary requirements. That also means repairing broken national security policy structure so that we can bring to bear the full weight of state capacity upon our strategic challenges. All this must be a dynamic process with constant readjustment given the dynamic nature of our time. This is a heady task for any government but we all understand that today the world has no good alternative to American leadership.

Russia Is At War With The West
NATO now acknowledges the growing challenge of Russia among other global threats but it and the governments who compose its membership refuse to acknowledge the fact that Russia is at war with the West and sees the West as an inveterate adversarial force.1 Moreover, Russian conduct has steadily become more brazen.
Thus Russia’s cyber and information warfare operations against the U.S. during the 2016 elections were carried out in ways that virtually announced that it was Russia that was attacking U.S. networks and defying Washington to retaliate against it.2
Putin and his subordinates have long since convinced themselves of the existence of threats from policies or systems that do not exist. There has been no systematic policy of democracy promotion for years from the West notwithstanding Russian complaints or the laments of those Western groups who support such programs.
Thus Russia has created an endlessly self-generating feedback mechanism of supposedly mounting threats that it must constantly intensify to sustain its unreformed political system and mobilization state and economy yet which do not, in fact, exist. Thus it would be relatively easy for Putin’s regime to persuade itself into believing that it is under imminent threat when no such threat exists.
This perspective underlies Moscow’s belief in the necessity of permanent mobilization, militarization and information warfare (IW). Moscow’s investment in the appurtenances of information warfare (IW) stems from its belief that it already is in a state of war with the West led by the US and that the internet in all its manifestations is an appropriate domain for conducting this war.3 And at least some members of the administration like UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have asserted (rightly) that Russian cyber interference in the integrity of our electoral process is “warfare.”4
Putin’s war against the West is directed against the U.S. and allied governments’ political and societal institutions to secure Putin’s regime and undo the post-Cold War settlement, particularly in Europe. But it should be understood that for Russian leaders Europe is and has been since Stalin nothing more than a satellite of Washington’s. They regularly decry this phenomenon as unnatural but that is what they see. Thus in August 2017, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that,
Anywhere, in any country – in Eastern Europe, in Central Europe – there are a lot of facts when the U.S. embassy literally runs the [political] processes, including the actions of the opposition – - I think they [American] themselves don’t consider it an intervention because, first they [think they] can do anything, and second, it’s in their blood.5
And in his interview with American film director Oliver Stone Putin stated that, NATO, “today it is an instrument of American foreign policy. There are no partners in it, only vassals.”6
But this is not a recent war. Vladimir Putin has been at war with the U.S. and the West for over a decade.7 Already on January 18, 2005 Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov told the Academy of Military Sciences, that,
3

Let us face it, there is a war against Russia under way, and it has been going on for quite a few years. No one declared war on us. There is not one country that would be in a state of war with Russia. But there are people and organizations in various countries, who take part in hostilities against the Russian Federation.8
More recently, Dmitri Trenin, Director of the Carnegie Endowment’s Moscow office observed that, for some time,” the Kremlin has been de facto operating in a war mode.”9 One sign of this war is that by 2007-08, European Security services were reporting an enormous expansion in Russian espionage, both traditional and economic, across Europe.10 That war is manifested in current military Russian thought as the promotion of “color revolutions” which the Russian military as any insurgency against authoritarian regimes in the recent past.11
In fact we may argue that war has been and is inherent in Putin’s project from the beginning. Indeed, some analysts trace covert actions against Rusia’s neighbors back to 1992 and the Russian interventions in Abkhazia and Moldova.12 Autocracy, Putin’s legacy from the Tsars and Soviets, presupposes empire in Russia and empire under present conditions all but forces Russia into a constant state of threat, if not war, against its neighbors since it is consumed with projects that diminish their sovereignty if not their territorial integrity.
Indeed, as Russian civilian and military leaders came around to the consenus that the West was behind all these color revolutions and was looking to destabilize Russia, they concluded that not only did Russia have to wage a counter or asymmetric war against the West, but that it also had to become more autocratic and militaristic to save itself. 13
This inherent gravitaton towards militarizaiton is inextricable from the fact that Russia continues to visualize itself as an empire. Already in 2000 Alexei Malashenko observed that Russia’s war in Chechnya is logical only if Russia continues to regard itself as an empire.14 Similarly Alexander Etkind observed in 2011 that Russian history remains one of internal colonialism.15 As Professor Alfred Rieber of the Central European University has written, “For Russia there was no hard and fast distinction between colonial questions and the process of state building. This was not true of any other European state.”16
This was also the situation in Soviet times as well where the state structure, domestic and foreign policy all came together and remains the case today.17 The wars in both Ukraine and the North Caucasus confirm that this is still the case. Indeed, Trenin, along with many other analysts, has acknowledged that Putin’s Russia is a Czarist state and this designation applies to more than just Putin’s personal status.18 As a result the wars in the North Caucasus, like the war in Ukraine, possesses extraordinary resonance for Russia’s past, present and future state structure. Therefore, we have good grounds to assert that the resort to war is inherent in the nature of the Putin state and program.19
The structure and nature of Russian politics also generates a constant predisposition to magnify a sense of threat, if only for domestic purposes, and a tendency towards securitization and even militarization of many if not all aspects of Russia’s politics, economy, and political rhetoric.20 In other words, the default option of Putin’s autocratic system which melds together kleptocracy, the ethos of Russian organized crime, the KGB and its successors and the Russian autocratic-imperial tradition inclines towards conflict with the West and repression at home.
4

As the Spanish prosecutor Jose Grinda who has investigated Russian criminal syndicates in Spain, stated, in the Russian case “one cannot distinguish between the activities of the government and organized crime groups.”21 Indeed these two elements of Russian governance are inextricably tied up together and so Russian autocracy as such presupposes a conflict against the West even though the nature of the leader’s personality is crucial.22 If we consider that Illarionov’s so-called wars also include “non-violent” conflicts and the possibility of heightened domestic repression using the instruments of force, this essay represents an inquiry into Putin’s wars and his “asymmetric strategy.”
In accordance with this statement, Russian officials have long believed and publicly professed that since 2003 the U.S. has been trying to foment democracy campaigns in Russia and the CIS to undermine existing regimes there.23 Accordingly they continually promote the image of Russia being a besieged fortress surrounded by linked enemies: foreign governments and democratic reformers.24 They thus extend further into contemporary Russian discourse the Leninist paradigm of linked internal and external threats and the justification for repression that accompanied that paradigm.
Today, professional Russian military writing defines the term “color revolution” essentially as an uprising stage-managed from outside by external political actors with an interest in the constitution of power in the affected state. The citizens of that state are merely passive bystanders or puppets of this external manifestation, a clear projection outward of how the Russian government views or wants to view its own citizens, and also the threats to it from their arousal.25
Furthermore this sense of being under perpetual threat from within and without means that Russian foreign (and defense) policy approaches its tasks from the standpoint of what the German philosopher Carl Schmitt called the presupposition of enemies or of conflict.26 We should take special note here concerning the explicit statement that the spread of democracy is a mortal threat to Russia’s rulers in and of itself.
Hence the demand for a free hand at home and abroad. But the demand for a free hand means an unconstrained foreign policy based wholly on power and the interests of the state conceived of in the most atavistic and unbridled form of Realpolitik, another example of the presupposition of being encircled by enemies.27 And it invariably devolves into a regime based on nothing more than pure power, i.e. nihilism.
Newly emerging factors reinforce this disposition towards conflict and militarization. Since Putin cannot and will not offer Russians economic reform, he must offer instead imperial circuses to solidify his domestic standing. And since the “war party” is ascendant in Russia, it too must orient policy towards repeated probes if not confrontations with the West.28
Beyond these factors the geopolitical presence of China also drives Russia to confront the U.S. to secure recognition as a great power.29 As Krastev also observes,
Contrary to conventional wisdom, Russia’s craving for global power status is not simply about nostalgia or psychological trauma. It is a geopolitical imperative. Only by proving its capacity to be a 21st century great power can Russia hope to be a real, equal partner with countries like China, which it needs to take it seriously. Believe it or not, from the
5

Russian perspective, interfering in the American presidential election was a performance organized mostly for the benefit of non-American publics.30
Moreover, “If Russia does not gain recognition internationally, this would have repercussions in terms of identity problems and raise questions about the ability of the state to guarantee order and society.”31 Therefore we should expect more probes, including nuclear ones or conventional threats backed up by nuclear saber rattling.
Putin’s Way Of War
We make a grave mistake if we fail to realize that Putin and the Russian government have a strategy. Putin, despite the widespread view to this effect, is not a mere tactician or an uncannily gifted one but he does have a strategy.32 To say this is not to make Putin out to be a strategic genius. It is only because of the U.S.’ seemingly inherent strategic insolvency and incompetence in crafting a grand strategy over the last generation that Putin has succeeded as much as he has and his reign has been marked by major strategic failures, e.g. in regard to Ukraine. Possession of a strategy does not ensure that it is a high-quality one, let alone a genius-like one.
Consequently, as Clausewitz indicated above, the first, and most critical or supreme and farreaching task of our leaders is to recognize that our socio-political center of gravity as well as those factors of our allies, our values and our defense interests are under attack and respond accordingly. In the light of the new concept of security and of continuing astonishing technological developments, this war is not primarily or even necessarily one of combat operations though such operations are constantly being threatened and oblige us to prepare to meet or conduct those kinetic threats.
Rather the war is against institutions and values that impart resilience and integrity to our society and state. It is fought using the full range of the instruments of power: diplomacy, information, military power and economics (including energy), referred to as DIME. Therefore the priority U.S. response is not a military one, though major investments are surely needed here. Rather we call upon the U.S. and the West to grasp the overarching cross-domain coercive strategy being deployed against it and to respond in analogous fashion, i.e. by a truly strategic multi-domain approach.
This war is fought simultaneously across numerous geographical theaters on multiple levels including not just those material elements listed above but also the cyber sphere and mass media and is thus an ongoing psychological struggle in which the effective deployment of information constitutes a robust force multiplier that can be cheaply, repeatedly, and massively deployed at little cost to unhinge or derange an adversary and its society.
Russian leaders, like their Soviet forbears, seek to compensate for military and economic weakness relative to the other great powers have thus innovated what they call a new generation of war or new type of war much as Lenin and Stalin used the international Communist movement and mass propaganda, along with a gradually developing Red Army in the interwar years, to lay the foundation for a permanent state of siege in world politics that only ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Not surprisingly, a leadership composed of KGB alumni under Putin has resurrected that kind of thinking and warfare, shorn of its Marxist ideology, but with its mentality
6

and tactics fortified by new technologies and new tactics deriving from the reach of that technology.
Consequently the Russian strategy, for all its innovation, grows out of profound Russian and Soviet historical roots and must be understood in the light of Russo-Soviet categories of thought and action, to be countered.33 Mirror imaging or complacent self-regard that our way of thinking and doing is better and that we only need do more of what we are doing or do it better will fail to come to terms with the current war and result in severe losses. Therefore it is incumbent upon us to grasp the nature of our situation and to innovate in both thought and action to meet these new challenges.
Although Russia more often than not utilizes non-kinetic tools like active measures, cyber and information warfare, and the energy weapon among others, this war features a profound militarization of Russian policy and an aggressive threatening posture towards the outside world. For example, in October 2017, Putin took the unusual step of publicly announcing his personal participation in a nuclear exercise using all three elements of Russia’s nuclear triad.34 Putin also attested to the ongoing militarization of Russian policy by announcing that over 2,500 military exercises had taken place in 2017.35
This is hardly surprising as Russia long ago abandoned any effort to impose democratic controls over its security services and has assigned its military intelligence service the GRU to formulate that threat assessment. Thus this hostile posture and the pervasive state message of Russia being a “besieged fortress” is an essential component of Putin’s domestic and foreign policy.
The resort to non-kinetic and information warfare, as defined by Moscow as the primary instrument of this warfare reflects Russia’s understanding that coordinated cyber and informational strikes, along with the synchronized use of all the other elements of DIME is what embodies contemporary warfare and that on this ground it can compete equally with the West.36 Indeed, much writing on Russian information and cyber war (which for Russian thinkers and writers are really two sides of the same coin) is not only the most important domain of contemporary war, but also under certain circumstances, it can, by itself lead to victory and the enemy’s strategic capitulation.37 The Russian definition of the terms cyber warfare (kibervoina) or information war, (informatsionnaya voina) or information confrontation (informatsioonoe protivoborstvo) is holistic.
In other words, cyber is regarded as a mechanism for enabling the state to dominate the information landscape which is regarded as a warfare domain in its own right. Ideally, it is to be employed as a whole of government effort along with other, more traditional, weapons of information warfare that would be familiar to any student of Russian or Soviet military doctrine, including disinformation operations, PsyOps, electronic warfare, and political subversion.38
Indeed, Russian military and civilian leaders alike increasingly expect that what they define as information warfare (IW), which includes cyber-strikes against critical infrastructure and C4ISR targets alike, will be the first strike of this war with the exception that IW goes on continually without letup.39
7

Moreover, they have for a long time fully believed that the U.S. and its allies are waging such war against Russia to the point of actually supporting terrorism as well as IW and Russian dissidents.40 From Moscow’ standpoint, NATO, even without being aware of it, has evolved what Paul Schulte calls a “strategic destabilization” capability,41 or “cross-domain coercion.”42
Cross-domain coercion has paid off for Putin because it grows out of his earlier experience in subordinating Russia to his rule through a domestic IW campaign in the first years of his presidency and thus is a proven concept.43 Consequently he and his team have grasped the critical importance of information to contemporary societies.44
Furthermore, leading Russian military figures like former Chief of Staff, General Yuri N. Baluyevsky and retired General Makhmut A. Gareyev, President of the Academy of Military Sciences, have openly discussed threats to Russia in which the country might suffer even a
33
crushing defeat without a shot being fired. Already a decade or so ago Gareyev stated that,
The breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, the parade of “color revolutions” in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan and so on show how principal threats exist objectively, assuming not so much military forms as direct or indirect forms of political, diplomatic, economic, and informational pressure, subversive activities, and interference in internal affairs... The RF’s security interests require not only that such threats be assessed, but also
34
that effective measures of countering them be identified.
In today’s environment, security no longer means primarily or exclusively the defense of the realm. Rather it denotes the resilience of a society to meet the multifarious challenges confronting it, including military defense. The integrity and resilience of societal and political institutions today is what Clausewitz would have called the center of gravity from which power springs for all belligerents in this war. In this perspective the centrality of accurate and true information to all socio-political activity, not just kinetic combat operations become quite clear.
Therefore Russian leaders and theoreticians rightly emphasize the information-psychological aspect of war as the most critical element, even more than actual combat operations and invest much time and resources to derange and unhinge actual and potential opponents. They see IW as a first strike and as something that can be waged continuously even in peacetime.45 Thus crossdomain coercion actually represents a form of warfare targeted on societies and states’ resilience and ability to comprehend and act upon reality.
These tactics highlight the fact that the psychology and character of the regime are essentially those of an intimidation culture. As the writers Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan observe, “The Putin system is all about intimidation, more often than actual coercion, as an instrument of control.” 46 The emphasis on nuclear weapons not only relates to this system or culture of intimidation, it also fully comports with the long-standing element of Russian political culture that relies on the external projection of fear in order to augment the regime’s domestic support.47
Consequently Putin’s strategy has been to amass instruments comparable to what he and his entourage believe the West is deploying against them and deploy them preemptively and uninterruptedly against the West. Moreover, while the West devalues nuclear weapons in rhetoric and policy Russia must elevate their utility because it lacks other means of suasion that can be
8

deployed instead of nuclear weapons and intimidating threats.48 This effort at nuclear intimidation continues.
The guidelines for this kind of war came right from Putin. In February 2012, Putin published a manifesto entitled “Rossiya I Menyayushchiyisiya Mir” (Russia and the Changing World) wherein he wrote that,
The notion of “soft power” is being used increasingly often. This implies a matrix of tools and methods to reach foreign policy goals without the use of arms but by exerting information and other levers of influence. Regrettably, these methods are being used all too frequently to develop and provoke extremist, separatist, and nationalistic attitudes, to manipulate the public, and to conduct direct interference in the domestic policy of sovereign countries. There must be a clear division between freedom of speech and normal political activity on the one hand, and illegal instruments of “soft power” on the other. The activities of “pseudo-NGOs” and other agencies that try to destabilize other countries with outside support are unacceptable.49
Thus Putin’s subsequent attacks on NGOs hardly came as a surprise. Neither is it a surprise that Putin subsequently began his systematic and ongoing campaign to enlist the special services to expand their coordination to prevent extremist and terrorist propaganda in the global information space.50
It should be emphasized here that the doctrine’s guidance is that these measures be launched in advance of actual combat operations, thus indicating that Information Warfare (IW) and Information Operations (IO) are peacetime affairs and not just wartime activities. In other words, IW and IO should occur all the time.
Corresponding to that understanding, A.A. Strel’tsov, a prominent Russian theorist of IW, defined an IO as, “activities coordinated in terms of time, efforts, and objectives performed by agents to implement government information policy over a relatively long period of time that are directed at carrying out mid-term or short-term political tasks.”51 In other words what we consider to be a time of peace, i.e. the absence of actual hostilities, Russia, as a matter of doctrine and policy is carrying out massive IW campaigns.
Russian leaders take both aspects of IW or information confrontation quite seriously. Chief of the General Staff, General Nikolai Makarov observed in early 2012 that while land and sea have ceased to be the main theaters of war, the focus has shifted into the aerospace and information spheres, including cyber security. Moreover, wise use is made of “asymmetric action, [and] the initial period of hostilities has begun to exercise a decisive effect on the way a war is waged and on its outcome.” Both kinds of IW can be used in that period.52 In this context it is hardly remarkable that President Medvedev tasked the armed forces in 2011 to develop measures “to destroy the information and control assets of an ABM system as part of a campaign emphasizing the information-technical aspect of IW.” 53
Russian definitions of IW and IO are notable because they openly talk of a long campaign that is carried on in peacetime to undertake what amounts to an information/intelligence preparation of the battlefield that can long precede the actual manifestation of overt conflict, as was the case in
9

Estonia and Georgia. Here again the distinction between peace and war has been effaced, indicating that from Moscow’s standpoint “war is peace” and is being waged conintinually, even now.
Therefore we can argue that at least in the efforts to influence a society’s “information space,” there is no distinction between war and peace and some would also argue among war, peace, and the use of social technology for criminal purposes. This is a new phase in a process of “neither war nor peace” and a direct continuation of the Leninist tradtion of a constant state of siege within and between states, societies, and blocs. Similarly there is no hard and fast definition, unlike U.S. thinking, between war and peace. Conflict in this environment is constant and one major target, especially in domestic political arenas or among populations at war with each other, is the mentality of the “home front”.
Therefore the following observations apply to Russia with particular force for several reasons. First, the expansion of the “theaters” of military operations from purely battlefield phenomena to the totality of states’ physical and socio-political networks can be construed as a direct evolution from the Leninist theory of political struggle.
Just as Lenin expanded “the state of siege” within Russian social democracy into a global one that reached its apogee in the Cold War and comprised struggles within states as well as between blocs on a global scale, information technology has vastly expanded the opportunities for almost anyone to conduct such operations in both real time and over time. Anyone can target anyone or anything else for as long as they want and do so with “plausible deniability.”
Moreover, in this context, information technology and the uses to which it can replace the strategic and political role played by indigenous Communist parties which functioned as a surrogate for combat power that was missing to affect the political balance of power in targeted countries. Russian leaders, even before Putin’s remarks above, openly viewed information technology as a non-military means by which they can achieve military, strategic, or political goals. One need not organize a ramified “organizational weapon” like the Communist Party to gain leverage if not control over a nation’s policies if information weapons can be used adroitly for those purposes.
Therefore current wars have brought home to the Russian military that, “it is difficult to overestimate the importance of the information factor in local wars and armed conflicts of the early 21st century.” 54 Equally importantly, the Russian power structures fully understand the capabilities of information weapons and the need for Russia to compete in their production and use.
Writing in 2006-07, Deputy Premier and Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov indicated Moscow’s full awareness of IW and that it was a surrogate for a more classical military kind of operation. Indeed, Ivanov openly admitted that IW and IO allowed Moscow to find a new weapon to use in what might be called purely political, i.e. non-violent, warfare and update the Leninist inheritance of using Communist parties, fifth columns, and intelligence penetration of targeted societies as weapons to obtain political and strategic advantages.
10

Ivanov’s statement strongly suggests that Russia sees its cyber capabilities as giving it asymmetric or alternative ways to counter these perceived Western challenges and threats by what are clearly militarily superior adversaries.55
Russian military writings are even more systematic and detailed about the inherent potential of IO and IW. A 2003 article by Naval Captain of the First Rank (Reserve) R. Bikkenin observed that IW not only occurs in the struggle between opposing military forces and technologies but also comprises “disorganization of all means of a society’s life support, including the enemy military infrastructure.”56 Bikkenin included as part of his categorization of IO the use of the media, leaflets, religious propaganda and showing the extension of IW to this domain as part of the general process of securitization.57
For example, according to Colonel S.G. Chekinov, electronic warfare will become an independent operation in future wars, not just a support operation. This has happened in the war with Ukraine. Likewise, we can expect further technological breakthroughs in next age generation weapons that will combine physical, informational, psychological, and even biological weapons in combat over vast areas, including outer space, i.e. multi-dimensional warfare.58 Remote operations will occur as much as direct force on force missions, the battlefield will be transformed into a “combat environment” concept, including virtual targets and the enemy’s entire range of psychological orientations and capabilities.59
Chekinov and Lt. General S. A. Bogdanov (Ret) have subsequently argued that information weapons can already tackle strategic tasks such as disorganizing enemy military and state control, the aerospace defense system (which Russian writers expect will be the first target in a conventional offensive) , deceiving the enemy, creating the desired public opinion, organizing protests against the enemy government, and launching other operations aiming at reducing the enemy’s will to resist.60
The Nuclear Dimension
Today, as Putin is deliberately generating a war psychosis at home and abroad; prominent displays of Russian nuclear capability aims to frighten and reassure Russian audiences while intimidating Western ones.61 As Schulte suggests, they are also used for domestic political and psychologicalinformational purposes as well.62 As he argues, devaluation of nuclear weapons not only reduces Russia’s domestic and global status, it also leaves Russia, in its leaders eyes, vulnerable to Western probes and attacks on both its foreign and domestic interests since they see us as using military power to threaten domestic change.63
While many writers have argued that Russia emphasizes its nuclear arsenal because it is one of the few things that enables it to claim parity with Washington and retain its overall great power status. We cannot lose sight of the overall importance in Russian political culture of displaying the state’s capacity to intimidate others. Just as Russia needs desperately to see itself as a great power, it equally needs to be feared abroad. But since intimidation expresses a psychological relationship between the parties involved, it makes perfect sense that the prominent display of nuclear weapons carries with it a powerful informational-psychological charge that also fully comports with Russian strategic thinking.
11

We see this thinking in a paper prepared for this project by Jacob Kipp and Matthew Kroenig.
In the past decade and a half, Russia has come to rely more on nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and for warfighting to manage local conflicts. The possibility of a local war against NATO remains Moscow’s highest priority security threat. Russia relies on the early resort to nuclear use in part to offset its aggregate conventional inferiority vis-à-vis NATO. Moscow’s concept of “de-escalatory” nuclear strikes envisions limited nuclear strikes on NATO targets early in a conflict in a bid to frighten Western leaders into suing for peace on terms favorable to Moscow. Even if such strikes are never employed, the possibility enhances Russia’s coercive leverage in a crisis and to blackmail threats in peacetime.64
But while nuclear use in a first-strike mode to retrieve a losing conventional war and force NATO to de-escalate may be part of the strategy of escalate to deescalate, that arguably is merely a part of a much broader nuclear strategy that relies heavily upon the psychological and intimidating component of nuclear weapons.65
In other words, we can see a broader nuclear strategy that aims to use these weapons to control the entire process of escalation throughout the crisis from start to finish. If the crisis becomes kinetic, then escalating to de-escalate may well become operative possibilities.
For instance, in a March 2015 meeting in Germany, Russian generals told Western delegates that any NATO effort to retake Crimea and return it to Ukraine would lead them to consider “a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military”.66 Apart from the obvious physical threat and its intimidation quotient, the information conveyed here clearly partakes of IW understood in Russian terms as manipulating opponents’ psychological reactions and hence their ensuing policies.
With similar ends in mind, Putin’s numerous remarks threatening nuclear strikes and the regular dispatch of bomber and submarine probes to all members of NATO are clearly intended to intimidate and deter.67 But it also is indisputable that for Russian leaders and commanders, nuclear weapons are to be used for war-fighting missions and operations. Sir Richard Shirreff, NATO’s Deputy SACEUR form 2011-2014, has stated that “Russia hardwires nuclear thinking and capability to every aspect of their defense capability.”68
Since NATO’s Kosovo operation in 1999, Russia has gradually developed both a capability and a strategy involving nuclear weapons that Western elites either cannot or will not understand. And it is much broader than the catch phrase “escalate to deescalate” implies.69 That formulation unfortunately exemplifies the increasing U.S. tendency (as U.S. understanding of foreign governments and their strategies decline) to mirror image countries like Russia and depict their strategies and goals as if they were America’s.
In fact the nuclear strategy is much broader than the strategy that is imagined here. Furthermore Chief of the General Staff, General Valery Gerasimov has recently admitted that Russia has violated the INF treaty and his description of Russia’s enhanced nuclear and aerospace strike capability attests to the priority these sectors receive.70
Russia’s nuclear strategy must be viewed in the context of its thinking about and conduct of contemporary war in general. Thus we now face an innovative kind of asymmetric warfare that
12

constitutes a comprehensive challenge that simultaneously and constantly comprise conflicts that need not have any discernible starting point or phases as in U.S. literature. To use the U.S. military terminology, it is always phase zero and there is no discernible gap between war and peace. Or, as Lenin might have said, and certainly behaved, politics is the continuation of war by other means.
Ceasefires, actual conventional warfare and incessant information warfare – defined as attempts to alter mass political consciousness in targeted countries – occur together or separately as needed and are in constant flux. Regular forces can be used conventionally or as proxies, irregular, or even covert forces allegedly for “peacekeeping” or other operations. The actual use of military force depends on the effectiveness with which non- military instruments of power, organized crime, ethnic or other irregular paramilitary groups, espionage, political subversion and penetration of institutions in the targeted country, economic warfare, IW, and special operations forces.
Outright victory need not be the intended or victorious outcome. It may be enough to secure constant leverage and influence on the military-strategic, political and social situation in a state of no war no peace. Therefore both prosecution of such a war and resistance against it demands “quick decision-making processes, effective inter-agency coordination, and well trained and rapidly deployable special forces.”71 Unfortunately those are all areas where NATO have been particularly deficient.
On February 20, 2012, then Prime Minister Putin said that, “We continue to see new areas of instability and deliberately managed chaos. There also are powerful attempts to provoke such conflicts even within the direct proximity of Russia and its allies’ borders.”72 Since for Putin and his subordinates Russia’s borders comprise the Soviet borders, we get here some sense of just how expansive these threat assessments are.
Moreover, in Russian military thinking even small wars near Russia possess an inherent tendency that could lead to their escalation into major and even nuclear wars. Thus on November 17, 2011, Chief of the General Staff General Nikolai Makarov told the Defense Ministry’s Public Chamber that:
The possibility of local armed conflicts virtually along the entire perimeter of the border has grown dramatically...I cannot rule out that, in certain circumstances, local and regional armed conflicts could grow into a large-scale war, possibly even with nuclear weapons.73
Therefore, given such threat assessments, Russia must undertake a huge conventional and nuclear buildup by 2020, if not beyond.74 For example, on February 27, 2013 President Putin told an expanded session of the Ministry of Defense Collegium that,
We see how instability and conflict are spreading around the world today. Armed conflict continues in the Middle East and Asia, and the danger of ‘export’ of radicalism and chaos continues to grow in our neighboring regions. At the same time, we see methodical attempts to undermine the strategic balance in various ways and forms. The United States has essentially launched now the second phase in its global missile defense system. There are attempts to sound out possibilities for expanding NATO further eastward, and there is also the danger of militarization in the Arctic. All of these challenges – and they are just a
13

few of the many we face – are of direct concern to our national interests and therefore also determine our priorities.75
This assessment is not just a personal or new one. Rather Putin has long argued this way and this assessment is also to be found in Russia’s new Foreign Policy Concept of 2013.
This strategy was conceived of as being inherently an asymmetrical one and has deep historical roots. In 2014 in his annual address to the Federal Assembly, Putin reiterated that, “We have no intention to become involved in a costly arms race, but at the same time we will reliably and dependably guarantee our country’s defense in the new conditions. There are absolutely no doubts about this. This will be done. Russia has both the capability and the innovative solutions for this.”76
Echoing such sentiments, Putin’s adviser for military policy, General Alexander Burutin wrote that, “A crucial element in our plans for the development of new armaments must be an orientation towards an asymmetric response to the development and entering into service of the expensive new systems of the developed foreign countries.”77 In this context, the Norwegian scholar Tor Bukkvoll remarked that in Russian thinking, asymmetric technologies should have a disruptive effect on new Western technologies, be developed in areas where Russian defense industry has particular advantages and be much cheaper to develop and produce than Western technologies. And these discussions also stress acquisition of anti-access and area denial (A2AD) systems and technologies.78
Therefore this orientation towards an asymmetric strategy must emphasize nuclear weapons, including among them both long-range, TU-22M3 strategic bombers and the short-range Iskander dual-use missile, as well as ICBMs, nuclear missile submarines, ground-based ballistic and cruise missiles, and a modernized conventional force to bypass the U.S.’ ballistic missile defense network (BMD). 79 More recently Putin has stated that Russia’s acquisition of SLCMS and ALCMs equalizes its status with the U.S and threatened that if Washington repudiates the INF treaty Russia will respond “immediately and symmetrically” by building its own intermediate range forces.80
Putin has repeatedly insisted that Russia focus on new and new types of weapons.81 Moreover, from Putin on down Russian writers almost unanimously see the U.S. threatening both the concept of strategic stability and Russia by simultaneously building a BMD system in Europe and Asia and the capabilities to launch a Conventional Prompt Global Strike (CPGS) using high-precision conventional weapons, mainly delivered by air. Therefore the aerospace attack is threat number one. These new weapons under construction comprise of nuclear, space, hypersonic weapons, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, many of which are intended to rebuff just such an attack, e.g. by using UAVs to counter UAVs.82
Putin’s emphasis on creating new generations of weapons based on new physical principles such as beam, geophysical, genetic, psychophysical and other technology. He also singled out cyber, information, and communications technology, noting that as high-precision weapons proliferate and become common they will become the main means for achieving a decisive victory over opponent, including in global conflicts. 83 Evidently these are the categories of weapons that comprise the asymmetric strategy.
14

Under the circumstances, the armed forces must follow a deterrence strategy and prepare for a quick and effective response to challenges, i.e. be ready for anything on the spectrum of conflict. Even so, nuclear weapons and thus deterrence, mainly of the U.S./NATO but also of China, in both the strategic and regional deterrence contingencies will remain the priority until and unless Russia can field high-tech competitive weapons. Subsequent directives regarding procurement have followed along these lines.
Moscow’s deployment of nuclear and conventional weapons indicates that it believes the former deters not only nuclear but conventional attacks. This mode of strategizing and thinking directly rebuts the complacent and groundless notion that nuclear weapons only deter other nuclear weapons. For Russia both sets of weapons are intended to deter the U.S./NATO aerospace attacks thereby allowing it to operate offensively within the umbrella of its potent integrated air defense system (IADS).
The 2008-12 defense reform that overhauled force structures and the C4I (command, control, communications, computers and intelligence) aspects of the military was then accompanied by reforms to the defense industry whose purpose is to provide high-tech weapons. This sequence goes beyond some Western assessments that overlooked the military rationale behind the overall economic reform of 2001-03 and accompanying administrative reforms.84
Rearmament was therefore not a second stage in reform but a third and in a sense a culminating. Much like Stalin in the 1930s, Putin argued in 2013 that “the changing geopolitical situation requires rapid and considered action. Russia’s Armed Forces must reach a fundamentally new capability level within the next 3-5 years.”85 On March 20, 2013 Prime Minister Medvedev seconded this demand.86 Medvedev argued that,
The creation of large integrated structure [in the Russian defense-industrial complex] is one of [Russia’s] top priority missions. This approach has withstood the test of time, the consolidation of forces along the lines of the great variety of sectors in the militaryindustrial complex is necessary... the restructuring of Russia’s defense-industrial complex must happen within timeframes that are compressed to the maximum extent necessary.87
Stalin or Brezhnev could not have said it better. Indeed, Medvedev called upon the defense industry not just to be a locomotive of economic and technological growth for the entire economy but also to grow at an annual rate of 10% in 2013-2015 and for productivity to grow at around 20% annually.88 According to Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, Russia will train around 2,000,000 technical and engineering workers for the defense-industrial complex by 2020 with a special education program and massive state subsidies.89 It should also be noted that Rogozin said here that,
The Cold War rudiments both in their organization, such as NATO, or propaganda, such as russophobia, forms have not disappeared. Western civilization is a condition of exhausting resources and is not going to give up the level of consumption which they got [and] have been used to for a long time. This means the struggle for access to these resources will become even more acute.90
Similarly, planning for the possibility of using Russian forces as expeditionary forces abroad also
15

preceded the seizure of Crimea in 2014 and was even announced in public.91 Syria was explicitly cited in 2012 as the example of such planning and the plans also contemplated the use of Chechen troops as is now the case.92
These considerations also raise the issue of whether or for how long Russia can sustain this military buildup. It has already been clear that the defense budget for 2017-19 may well be cut cosmetically or merely seemingly.93 But even if the defense budget is meaningfully reduced, Steven Rosefielde strongly argues that Putin has found a workable solution to get as much as he can out of the military-industrial complex with all of its multifarious economic pathologies. Rosefielde thus concludes that,
Russia is weathering the storms of plunging natural resources prices and EU economic stagnation better than predicted, and appears on both defense and civilian grounds to provide ample support for Putin’s belief that he can successfully resist color revolutions and regime change in non-EU states of the former Soviet Union; thwart democratization, EU accession and NATO expansion on the Kremlin’s turf, and expand Moscow’s influence in Europe.94
Thus even without reform or transformation of the current economic situation, Russia can still largely though not completely fulfill the outlines of the vast defense reindustrialization and procurement program for 2011-2000 without breaking the bank either economically or politically at home. The recent rise in energy prices, Arab and Chinese support, and apparent bottoming out of the 2014-17 recession suggest that this neo-Soviet economic system of mobilization for war can survive for some time to come.95
Certainly Russian leaders seem to believe that energy will remain their “gravy train” for some time to come. Contrary to the facile and complacent statements regularly proffered that Russia cannot sustain its defense program for the next 3-4 years Rosefielde’s view appears to be supported as well by other Western findings such as those by this author, Richard Connolly and Julian Cooper.96
Russian Objectives
To grasp the nature of this war and respond accordingly we must also understand Moscow’s objectives. Obviously the primary objective is to secure the regime from the unceasing attack it believes is inherent in Western and especially American policy, namely preventing Russia from assuming its supposedly foreordianed position as a great, imperial power and dominating the former Soviet territory, what it now calls Eurasia. But this objective goes deeper than a demand for restoration of hegemony of the former USSR. We should be clear that for Russia the demand for respect and great power status means empire or some kind of contemporary analogue to it. This could include territorial revisions of European frontiers as in Ukraine and Georgia, not just anaugmentation of Russian power in its borderlands although that latter goal is certainly critical.
So while Russian history may have bequeathed a heavy imperial legacy, Russian state policy, the current nature of the state and its resemblance to earlier formations represent the result of conscious elite decisions to seize power and hold it in accordance with Russian traditions, i.e. without recourse to democratic and legal means, even if today’s world is utterly transformed from that of
16

the past. And those traditions most assuredly include as a key core interest of the state, retention of its neo– imperial outlook, tendencies, and powers.
Empire is, therefore, the natural and possibly most critical corollary of Putin’s domestic autocracy. Indeed, autocratic empire is essentially the only form of state comprehensible to the Russian elite and could not survive without empire autocracy. Moreover, “pride in the empire is an important element of consolidating society around the president and legitimizing the current authorities.”97 Putin has abundantly demonstrated that he cannot and will not provide the benefits of prosperity that only economic reform could bring. Instead he and his entourage insist on preserving not just the autocracy but the dependence on energy which they believe can last at least another generation.
Igor Sechin, Rosneft’s CEO, has publicly stated his view that while oil and gas consumption might slowly decrease globally over the next 30 years, they will remain primary sources of energy worldwide. The implication is, therefore, that Russia and companies like Rosneft can continue to place their reliance upon extracting hydrocarbons as a principal source of income, wealth and power.98 Since empire is now the sole justification of autocracy along with the related obsession of proving that Russia is a great power before whom other powers are afraid and at the same time intent on destroying it, the domestic drivers for furhter neo-imperial probes, as suggested by Krastev above remain intact.
This obsession with great power long predates Putin but remains a crucial driver of many of his policies. Many different scholars long ago concluded that since public opinion is very interested in asserting Russia’s great power standing, the elite and Putin must also be so interested even if they were not so personally and emotionally committed to this idea as they are. These domestic factors pervade all foreign and defense policymaking and particularly relevant with regard to Moscow’s intervention in Syria for they provide the domestic basis for why Putin opted to intervene there. The overwhelming evidence is that this sentiment grips Russian elites and society even without the government’s systematic saturation of the media on this point.
This concept that Russia is simultaneously both inherently a great power and a state that deserves to be seen at home and abroad as such or as an empire in order to survive – even if this can only be asserted irrationally and not by empirical demonstration – is embodied in the term Derzhavnost. This belief in Russia’s great power destiny is an article of faith not subject to critical thinking. By trying to banish any hope of understanding Russian politics through critical, rational analysis, exponents of this view also typically overcompensate for the fear that if Russia is not a great power and not seen as such then it will be nothing. Putin, Yeltsin, and many other figures like former Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Evgeny Primakov have repeatedly echoed this sentiment about Russia as an inherent great power who must act independently of other “poles” of the international system.
This understanding becomes particularly important because the Russian government explicitly regards its domestic security as unstable and the state as having failed to achieve the “necessary level of public security.” 99 And this instability is traceable, in no small measure, to Islamic terrorism and criminality associated with that terrorism.100 Therefore preventing the spread of terrorism beyond and ultimately eliminating it in the North Caucasus are major state priorities. Russian leaders’ endless repetition of the fact that they intervened in Syria to prevent terrorists from returning home clearly has a basis in Russian policy and implicitly underscores the
17

connection from internal to external security even if Moscow facilitated the terrorists’ movement to Syria to reduce the incidents of terrorism in the North Caucasus.101
Meanwhile this domestic instability clearly impedes realization of the great project of the Putin regime: restoring Russia to acknowledged great power status not only in the former Soviet sphere but beyond its borders. Therefore Moscow’s actions abroad commingle internal and external means of ensuring security in oreder to realize this great power program.
Solidifying Putin’s autocratic system at home necessarily entails blowing up the international status quo. It means undemining not only the soveriegnty and territorial intgegrity of the states around Rusia and exporting something like Putinism to them. In geopolitical terms it means reversing the process of European integration under democratic auspices that constitutes the fundmental threat to a restored Russian empire. Hence the invaison of Ukraine. As Vsevolod Horbulin observes,
The geopolitical purpose of Russia with the start of the global hybrid conflict was: to destroy the existing world order in order to restore the tension of the Cold War period and to occupy a position in this new world order while taking into account the strenghtened China.102
The objective is to recover for Russia the status claimed in 1971 where he stated that no question in world politics can be decided without the participation of the Soviet Union. Or as Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says now, “Not a cannon can be fired in Europe without our consent.”103 For example, in the Middle East, as a result of its successful Syrian campaign,
No state will be able to bypass Moscow when resolving regional conflicts. Already, France and Italy are turning to Russia to help integrate Khalifa Haftar, the Libyan military strongman whom Moscow has cultivated, into a UN-backed political arrangement.104
Not surprisingly, as part of this grand and neo-imperial design to undo the post-Cold War settlement, Moscow recognizes neither the territorial sovereignty nor the integrity of any of the states of the former USSR or Warsaw Pact.105 Therefore a major part of the new war it has waged represents an attempt to dismember that sovereignty, and if necessary their integrity, to restore Moscow’s power as a player equal to the U.S. globally that is capable and willing to challenge it globally and regionally.
Putin actually warned us about Ukraine for at the Bucharest NATO summit he told President Bush that, “But George don’t you understand that Ukraine is not a state.” Putin further claimed that most of its territory was a Russian gift in the 1950s. Moreover, while Western Ukraine belonged to Eastern Europe, Eastern Ukraine was “ours”. Furthermore, if Ukraine did enter NATO, Russia would then detach Eastern Ukraine (and the Crimea) and graft it onto Russia.
Thus Ukraine would cease to exist as a state. 106 Putin also said that Russia regards NATO enlargement as a threat so if Georgia received membership, Moscow would “take adequate measures” and recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia to create a buffer between NATO and Russia.107 Neither was Putin’s outburst unrepresentative of Russian foreign policy. Instead it mirrors numerous statements by officials made to former Soviet republics and Eastern European states to the effect that they are not really sovereign states.108

More specficially Moscow aims to create regional bipolarity everywhere with the help of partners to force the U.S. to accept it as equal in creating and consolidating a multipolar world order where Russia is one of the poles that must be consulted anytime a crisis breaks out. Force or its surrogates in the form of economic and information warfare are major instruments of power to foster these outcomes. Meanwhile in Europe, Moscow’s allies will be those governments or political movements that not only want to trade with it but that also espouse its domestic governing system, not the least part of which is systemtic corruption, or are enemies of European integration. Hence the ongoing subisides to these political partiis and intervention in elections and referendums.
The following list comprises Russia’s strategic objectives with regatrd to Europe. Since the 1990s Russian intellectuals and leaders have articulated a vision of bipolarity where the U.S. presides over a western bloc and Russia dominates an eastern bloc made up of former Soviet republics and and satellites in Eastern Europe. Thus an overarching goal is the re-creation of something resembling this vision of bipolarity. In concrete terms the objective are as follows:
Post-Soviet republics may retain their nominal or de jure sovereignty but it will be a compromised or “perforated’ sovereignty at best, where Moscow exercises the real power over them. Ethnic and religoius issues in these states will be manipulated, along with the use of corruption and all the instruments of subversion to ensure that pro-Moscow factions dominate wherever possible and discrete territorial or ethno-religious communities will be subordinated politically, culturally, and militarily to Russia. This means that their territgorial integrity, e.g. the Moldovan, Ukrainian, Georgian or Azerbaijan, will be at risk if not actually compromised.
Militarily, Moscow will enjoy long-term if not perpetual bases (air, land, and sea) and suasion over the deployment of these countries’ own military forces as in Armenia’s case or loose liaison if not penetration as in Belarus.109 We can also expect permanent Rusisan air and sea deployments in Syria and around the Eastern Mediterranenan to fence that sea off along with the entry to the Black Sea, to NATO forces and thus isolate Turkey.
Lastly Moscow will make every effort, using all of the instruments of power, to ensure that these governments are not and do not become democratic and that they are tied economically to Russia either bilaterally or through the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU). Ukraine may be a lost case but Moscow is still trying, for example, to entice Azerbaijan into the EEU.110 Equally if not more importantly, Russia will consistently endeavor to ensure not only the dominance of pro-Russia factions but that the state in all of these countries take on as much of the domestic trappings of Putinism as is possible.
Further West, Moscow will utilize all the instruments of power to arrest and hollow out NATO enlargment and prevent the placement of U.S. forces in Eastern Europe. It also is critical for Moscow to prevent the deployment of missile defenses since they are not only a visible embodiment of the U.S. commitment to defend its allies but also negate Moscow’s major psychological-military threat to rain down conventional and/or nuclear missiles on Europe. A recent detailed revelation of recent Russian accomplishments in the fields of missile and aerospace attack and defense by Chief of the General Staff, Genreal Valery Gerasimov, openly admits that Russia has violated and is violating the INF trreaty and has developed multiple strike capabilitries for ranges up to 4000KM.111
19

Thus even if Moscow proposes arms control in Europe, the military objective is to neutralize NATO as a cohesive and coherent fighting force, divide U.S. and European allies from each other and retain full freedom to act in its “sphere of interests” militarily with impunity and free from possible retribution. Then not only will former Soviet republics fall under Moscow’s sway but territories from Finland to Turkey will come under greater and presuambly irrestibile military threats. This military outcome also entails an expanding A2AD network of land, sea, air, and cyber wepons to keep the West out of the Arctic, Baltic and Eastern Mediterranean seas. This effort to deny the West access into those seas through integrated networks of naval and air defense recalls the Soviet bastion strategy for its Navy.
In informational and subversion terms, Moscow will continue to acquire ever more media influence in Western media either through ownership or corruption and subordination of media and political parties across Europe, often by subsidizing those organizations. It will use the lodgments achieved thereby to establish permanent “beachheads” of pro-Russian business, political, and media elites in key commanding positions thorughout Europe. Simultaneously it will endeavor to insert itself into EU economies and either obtain a special status, or seek to bypass or nullify EU rules that hinder its objective of dominance on the continent.
Wherever possible, Russia will seek to work bilaterally with individual governments to get around the necessity of dealing with the EU as a whole or simply to circumvent it and the European Commission. This will allow more and more unhampered energy exports to Europe and acquisitions of key roles in other sectors, not least of which is domestic distribution of gas. Revenues from these acquisitions and exports will continue going to corrupt and subsidize European elites who, in return, will supoprt Russian political initiatives, push for more exports to Russia on generous terms and advocate for more technology transfer to Russia, both civil and military.
In practice, both the EU and NATO will be subjected to cross-domain coercion tactics and instruments that will corrode both organizations from within over time even if they remain nominally functional or viable. The hoped-for goals are the evisceration over time of both the processes of European integration and as Sergei Karaganov, one of Rusisa’s most prominent foreign policy analysts, told Bloomberg, “We are not interested in any kind of unity in the Transatlantic alliance, the weaker the better.”112 A critical objective here is for Moscow to stop the pressure of Western democracy promotion and of accurate reporting concerning the increasingly repressive and even totalitarian nature of Putin’s system and to bail it out by loans, trade, invesmtents, and technology transfer.
Through the immense and unblocked use of IW in all of its manifestations Moscow will also obtain permanent presence in Western political systems that have hitherto not yet figured out how to repulse these information onslaughts or punish Russia for them. So we can duly expect to see more interference in Brexit-like referendums, election interference as in Holland, Germany, France, and the U.S., and media penetration as in the Balkans. Likewise we can expect more military threats, saber-rattling of both conventional and nuclear weapons, and potentially more or bigger military operations in areas where Russian forces are already active. Thus the fundamental threat to European security and the Transatlantic alliance is political.
20

We can duly expect more initiatives along these lines to break up European integration and influence political outcomes across Europe, exploit any possible fissure in the structure of European governments, and thus block progress towards either European integration or democratization. The exposure of Russian interference in stoking the fires of the Catalan question in Spain excellently illustrates the rapidity with which this information weapon can be turned on or off not to create but to exploit existing cracks in European structures.113
There is no reason to assume Moscow will stop trying to play the Russian diaspora card in the Baltic States, Ukraine, and elsewhere or stop inciting ethno-religious minorities to incite ethnoreligious and political disturbances, friction, and pretexts for intervention. Because Russia has invested heavily in a cultural-political project entitled the Russian world that attempts to weaponize the diaspora for its political purposes there is no reason to turn off this weapon when it can be reinstated at any moment. The fact that Russia’s formal, legal boundaries do not conform to what the regime imagines its cultural borders to be offers opportunities for stirring up not just the Russian diaspora but the national card across Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.114
This particular manifestation of Putin’s asymmetric strategy privileges the information or ideological domain in these borderlands and the West as the primary tool of power in the so called Near Abroad: namely ideological influence. Here Russia relies on inciting Russian language speakers, compatriots, and the so called Russian-speaking world in order to create a base to expand Russian influence abroad, destabilize targeted states, and then, having fractured those states, conquer and then annex them to create new bases for further expansion on other pretexts.
We can also expect Moscow to keep arguing through its supporters, trolls, and “useful idiots” for the erosion of the American commitment to European security. Indeed, the current forms of political and information warfare will probably continue to serve as the day-to-day mainstays of Russian operations across the West because information weapons are replacing fire-strike weapons as the main weapons of conflict.115
Insofar as Russia’s borderlands are the site of the most intense forms of this political and military warfare, support for European integration and the Transatlantic alliance must become even more visibly the central pillars of U.S. strategy. Western ideological-political presence in these countries, not only “infects” Russia, it holds up a mirror to Russia that enables the population to see just how badly they are governed. That presence also conclusively negates the return of the imperial option without which autocracy becomes infeasible. Therefore this influence must be extruded from those borderlands at all costs for nothing less than the survival of the state depends on keeping those borderlands as spheres of exclusive Russian influence.
That objective mandates establishing “beachheads” of Russian economic, cultural and political influence and lasting military presence in those states to keep them as either buffers to push the West back or as bases from which Moscow can threaten the West. This objective also underlies the construction of the robust and integrated A2AD air, land, and naval defense network that we now see coming into being across these borderlands.
Underlying this strategy is the perception of a decadent Europe that is unable to resolve its sociomoral dilemmas and is falling apart. To quote one of Putin’s most articulate and duplicitous ideologues and agents, Vladislav Surkov, “hypocrisy in the rationalist paradigm of the Western
21

civilization is inevitable.” Furthermore, “we know examples when civilizations reached a dangerous limit of complexity. what followed was either a collapse or a life-saving simplification of the system.”116 This mantra tells Russians and foreign audiences that the Russian system is superior but it also reveals that even as Russian leaders want to live like Westerners and hide their money there, they have to denigrate the society for their own psychological needs to compensate for the reality that they discern around them and know is all too dangerous and backward.
While psychologically compensatory mechanisms are at work here, this perception of European decadence, i.e. Europe’s failure to become a self-standing pole of the “multipolar world order” facilitates Russian efforts to expose all the internal schisms in European societies. Consequently revitalizing European integration and economic and political development should be a prime objective of the West’s strategy. Facilitating those trends enhances European resilience, helps contribute to making Europe a genuine pole of power in world affairs, and negates Russia’s strategy as close to its borders as possible. Ultimately Ukraine should be included in this revitalization and even enlargement of the EU.
These internal schisms within Western societies are a weakness because they are exposed. Moscow must exploit those weaknesses while simultaneously insulating them from Western influence. It is the simultaneous and paradoxical perceptions of Western conventional military and materialideological superiority and of decadence, weakness, and excessive pacifism that underlie Moscow’s concept of the Western threat and of the tactics, instruments, and strategies chosen to confront it at home and abroad. Thus the form in which Russia’s strategic goal of arresting or reversing Western democratic integration appears is Moscow’s unrelenting efforts to corrupt and corrode European public and security institutions, the EU, NATO and individual governments and states.
Not only would achievement of this objective relieve domestic pressure on the regime, it would allow Russia to dominate its neighborhood more or less free of Western political intervention, attacks or ideological diffusion of democratic norms. Moscow could then appear as the equal of the U.S. who must have a voice on all major international issues, especially those in Europe, the former Soviet space, and the Middle East. Consequently Moscow insists on both the necessity for and existence in fact of this multipolar world where it claims the right to be a “system-forming” pole equal to the U.S. and China.117
Out of Area Operations: Arctic and Syria
Russian security policy not only updates the Leninist threat assessment of linked internal and external enemies who are eveready to pounce, it also updates the foreign policy basis of this threat assessment. The components of this set of perceptions are the ongoing deterioration of world politics, the rise of more threats, particularly to Russia’s political order or to seize its natural resource wealth and the attendant need to squelch both foreign-incited revolutions as in the Arab Spring and foreign access to the Arctic.
This assessment predated the seizure of Crimea. Even though Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Denisov told an interviewer in 2011, “Luckily, we have virtually no enemies in the world today”, that is not Moscow’s stated view.118 Indeed, former Chief of Staff Yuri Baluyevsky stated that the U.S. maintains a factor of preventive nuclear strikes in its and NATO’s strategy against Russia
22

and/or China and this is tied to the missile defense program.119 Similarly Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told an audience at the annual 2013 Munich Security Conference that,
Even in the conditions of deficit of financial resources an increase in military activities is observed in the north and centre of Europe, as if in these regions the security threats are mounting. Advancement of projects for NATO’s further expansion and advancement of bloc’s military infrastructure to the East is continuing – as if there were no top-level statements on fatality of preserving dividing lines on the continent. Speaking of this, some of our European partners are now inventing new dividing lines, begin trying to artificially divide integration projects into “good” and “bad”, “friendly” and “alien”.120
On February 20, 2012, then-Prime Minister Putin said, “We continue to see new areas of instability and deliberately managed chaos. There also are powerful attempts to provoke such conflicts even within the direct proximity of Russia and its allies’ borders.” 121 Since for Putin and his subordinates Russia’s borders comprise the Soviet borders we get here some sense of just how expansive these threat assessments are. Therefore, on the basis of such threat assessments, Russia must undertake a huge conventional and nuclear buildup by 2020. 122 On February 27, 2013 President Putin told an expanded session of the Ministry of Defense Collegium that,
We see how instability and conflict are spreading around the world today. Armed conflict continues in the Middle East and Asia, and the danger of ‘export’ of radicalism and chaos continues to grow in our neighboring regions. At the same time, we see methodical attempts to undermine the strategic balance in various ways and forms.
The United States has essentially launched now the second phase in its global missile defense system. There are attempts to sound out possibilities for expanding NATO further eastward, and there is also the danger of militarization in the Arctic. All of these challenges – and they are just a few of the many we face – are of direct concern to our national interests and therefore also determine our priorities.123
This assessment is not just a personal or new one. Rather, Putin has long argued this way and this assessment is also to be found in Russia’s new Foreign Policy Concept. Thus in 2012, he wrote that the global economic-financial crisis is systemic and marks a transition to a new geopolitical era. As a result the world is entering into a new period of turbulence which will be prolonged and painful.
Russia’s interest in the Arctic is hardly new. There is also no doubt that given Russia’s geographical proximity to the Arctic, it has loomed, and will continue to loom in Moscow’s visions and policy. As Sergei Golunov has written, “proximity induces ‘grand desires’ when the willingness to exploit proximity is conflicting with illusory or limited opportunities. Even though sometimes such desires do not bring significant changes, they have some influence on regional, and sometimes even on global public discourse.”124
Thus, the 1997 Federal Target Program “World Ocean” placed special emphasis on the Russian littorals, including the Barents Sea, as foundations of Russian maritime power and as a base from which Russia could exploit oceanic resources. The program also noted that more than 80 percent
23

of Russia’s then known oil and gas reserves were located in the shelf of the Barents and other northern seas.125 Sensitivity to the energy potential of the Arctic predates the Putin regime.
Similarly, in September 2000, the Ministry of Natural Resources announced that Russia possesses the right to incorporate an additional 1.2 million square kilometers of the Arctic continental shelf into its territorial waters based on discoveries made by a Russian research vessel far beyond the 200-mile economic exclusion zone claimed by Moscow. It also announced it would subsequently hand over the required documents to the UN to substantiate this claim.126
This was before the U.S. Geological Survey of 2006 found even greater amounts of reserves and minerals in Russia’s Arctic waters. This enduring confluence of seeing the Arctic as simultaneously the home of Russia’s future energy–economic resources and of equally vital naval bases and targets ensures that in Russia, thinking about the Arctic economics and energy cannot be neatly distinguished from each other as guides to policy. This is recognized as well by foreign observers.127
Given Russia’s enduring proximity to the Arctic and prior interest, it is not surprising that in 2007, soon after his famous speech to the Munich Wehrkunde that threw down the gauntlet to the West, Putin launched a systematic campaign to induce acceptance of Russia’s expansive claims to the Arctic under UNCLOS. This campaign took off not from the atmosphere of Putin’s truculent Munich speech, but rather from the general belief of the Russian establishment that the Arctic was a potential treasure trove and Russia was now under attack from the West.
Numerous commentators at home and abroad have observed that for some time, Russia has cast itself as a “besieged fortress”, charging Washington with imperialism, launching an arms race, interfering in the domestic policies of CIS states, including Russia, expanding NATO, unilateralism, disregarding international law when it comes to using force and resorting to military threats against Russian interests.128 This wide-ranging threat perception also embraces Russia’s domestic politics as well and justifies domestic immobilism under the need to mobilize the state.
Regime spokesmen Vladislav Surkov, the father of the sovereign democracy concept, also openly stated that Russia must take national control of all the key sectors of the economy lest they be threatened by hostile foreign economic forces and so-called “offshore aristocrats.”129 In other words, this threat perception links both internal and external threats in a seamless whole and represents the perception that Western democracy is a threat to Russia. Therefore, U.S. and Western military power, even if it is not actually a threat, is a priori perceived as such. And this threat assessment and the suggested remedies to this perception of threat are clearly militarized ones apart from considerations of climate change.
Not surprisingly, and especially after the U.S. Geological Survey of the Arctic in 2006—the only attempt at systematic research into Arctic natural resource endowments—Russian elites drew attention to both the resource endowment and its link to defense in heightened fashion. In June 2007, Admiral Vladimir Vysotsky, CINC of the Russian Navy, drew heightened attention to the Arctic which he claimed furnished Russia with 90 percent of its gas, 60 percent of its oil, over 90 percent of its nickel and cobalt, about 60 percent of its copper and 98 percent of its platinum metals. While eight percent of the population lived in the Far North, they produced about two percent of the national income and accounted for two-thirds of the hard currency earnings.130 Thus, he was
24

staking out a rationale for a priority naval role in the Arctic beyond the long-standing vital necessity of defending Russia’s SSBNs in the Northern Fleet in the Kola Peninsula.
Vysotsky’s remarks predated the subsequent expedition led by Duma member Artur Chilingarov to the North Pole that led to the publicizing of Russia’s claims, and what might be called the start of the new scramble for the Arctic. Indeed, Chilingarov had warned in the Duma on June 21, 2007, that Russia intended to stand up for its lawful rights in the Arctic. 131 Russia’s claims under UNCLOS, or rather the fact of a Russian claim, was perfectly within the legal parameters of UNCLOS. Moscow had ratified UNCLOS in 1997 but it did so with the important reservation that it would not accept “the procedures leading to the compulsory decisions regarding the disputes related to Articles 15, 73 and 83 that concerned delimitation of maritime borders and EEZ.”132
Indeed, Russian policy originates in the belief that everyone covets its energy resources. Carl Schmitt states that Russian security policy begins from the generalized presupposition of threat and this outlook is apparent in every Russian official doctrinal and official statement of the last decade.133 Russia’s 2013 Foreign Policy Concept openly states that as competition grows around the sources of raw materials, their exchanges and their markets, this source of competition could become a trigger for future conflicts. 134 Official documents since then have reinforced and expanded this threat assessment.135 Consequently, Russia’s ensuing military buildup of the Arctic evidently intends to go beyond any idea of defending what really is a rather secondary theater.
Instead, Russia plans to engage the Arctic fully in defense planning for a myriad of threats going beyond risks to energy platforms and weather-related mishaps or dangers to commercial shipping to include full-blown military scenarios that comprise Europe, as was the case during the Cold War. Certainly, its deployments listed below indicate that Russia views the Arctic as a potential theater in a bigger European or even Trans-Atlantic war. But it also clearly sees security threats to its position in the Arctic originating in the Asia–Pacific region as well. These threats comprise a NATO or U.S. aerospace attack with missiles, air and naval strikes and even potential amphibious landings in the Arctic to seize energy installations.
Recent accounts indicate the magnitude of Russia’s conversion of the Arctic into an international security problem. Moreover, Russia announced plans for continuing military expansion in the Arctic in 2017.136 Russia’s Ministry of Defense has announced that it is building over 100 facilities in the Arctic on its bases in the Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya archipelagos, Sredny Island, Cape Schmidt, and Wrangel and Kotelny Islands.137 U.S. figures show that in recent years, Russia “unveiled a new Arctic command, four new Arctic brigade combat teams, 14 new operational airfields, 16 deep-water ports, and 40 icebreakers with an additional 11 in development.”138
Russia is also building up new Arctic coastal forces and state-of-the-art over-the-horizon radars that indicates its belief that the Arctic is likely to be the route through which a NATO aerospace attack is likely to come.139 As a result, “interviews with officials and military analysts and reviews of government documents show Russia’s build-up is the biggest since the 1991 Soviet fall and will, in some areas, give Moscow more military capabilities than the Soviet Union once had.”140
So while the Arctic remains peaceful today, the military build-up, along with everything else that is happening, cannot but inflame allied suspicions. Putin has now called on the Duma to pass laws that offer “ships sailing under the Russian flag the exclusive right to carry and store hydrocarbons
25

along the Northern Sea Route,” an action that will “allow the growth of the amount of such shipments, strengthen the position of domestic shipping companies and create additional opportunities for the renewal of the fleets belong to them”141 While this new decree accords with the drive towards import substitution and economic autarky, it will also anger other states trading through the Northern Sea Route like China and shows the abiding bias towards thinking about waterways near Russia as closed seas that are off limits to foreign, i.e. Western access. Because Russia’s current threat assessment is so extravagantly out of alignment with the reality of other Arctic states’ capabilities, we cannot simply count on the Arctic remaining a zone of peace.
The Role Of China
Since 1991 it has been clear that any Russian state must have friendly ties with China to survive. Yet the movement of Russo-Chinese relations over the past generation has been unis-directional towards what both governments call a strategic comprehensive partnership. However, minority view of this relationship is that it has evolved since 2014 into a real alliance where China is the rider and Russia the horse. For Moscow to implement its anti-Western strategy on a global basis, it must have and increasingly depends on both material and intangible political diplomatic support from China.
A starker but not altogether way of putting this is that Russia increasingly can play the superpower game against the West because China allows it to and thus Moscow’s claim to superpower or system-creating status in world politics increasingly depends on Chinese forbearance and support, both material and intangible. Whether one calls this an alliance or uses the two governments’ term cited above, the fact of this growing dependence is incontrovertible. That reality is one of shared, identical, or converging positions on a host of international security issues that allows Russia to challenge the West secure in the knowledge of Chinese support.
Putin’s post-2012 presidency already heralded pro-Chinese policies as Russia sought to “catch the wind of China’s growth in its sails.”142 In 2016 Putin stated that,
As we know the Sino-Russia relationship is now at its best. We often call it the strategic partnership, which I think is not only at a political level but also at the economic one. China is Russia's largest trading partner, although bilateral trade volumes have dropped a little due to the sluggish oil prices. To my delight, our cooperation has continued to diversify. Recently, trade volumes in high-tech and manufacturing fields have grown significantly. The large cooperation projects in aviation, aerospace, energy and nuclear power look promising. – We share common views in a series of international issues. Undoubtedly, it's a key factor in maintaining stability. We cherish the relationship with China and hope to further push it forward.143
Russia’s deepening structural economic-political crisis paralleled and intensified Putin’s policy, leading to another decade of stagnation from 2008-17 and further decline relative to China. Consequently, the most critical element in Sino-Russian relations is the growing asymmetry of power between China and Russia in China’s favour.144 Indeed, Russia has frequently solicited China for a formal alliance. China’s practical response conforms to alliance dynamics even if it formally eschews alliances.
26

The hallmarks of this alliance dynamic are reversals of Russian policies to China’s benefit, support for China on Asian regional issues and Russia’s asymmetrical dependence upon Chinese economic, political and military support. Despite difficulties in economic issues and particularly in Central Asia, the evidence for all three hallmarks even in these domains is quite strong. Thus, China is the rider and Russia the horse in this alliance. By 2009, economic weakness forced Moscow to reverse past policy and admit China into its plans for developing Russia’s Far East.145 By 2012 analysts noticed China’s ability to impose its agenda on Russia and gain disproportionate benefits from Russia while avoiding any lasting commitment to Russia’s calls for an alliance.146 This is even truer today.147
This de facto if not formal Sino-Russian alliance derives from geopolitically and ideologically congruent perspectives aiming squarely at America’s values, interests, and the world order it largely created. It is not a binding wartime alliance like NATO or pre-World War I alliances but today’s concept of alliances is much more elastic and therefore suitable to both sides. Admittedly these are contentious claims for many, possibly most, analysts deny that an alliance is occurring or is sustainable.148
Vasily Kashin, Senior Research Fellow at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of the Far East, recently wrote that both sides may avoid the term “alliance” but the relationship already far exceeds “neighborliness” or even “strategic partnership” even though China’s lasting gains in Asia are arguably at Moscow’s, not Washington’s, expense, most obviously in Central Asia. 149 Therefore we must understand what is meant by such an alliance. As Lavrov stated in 2014,
If we talk about alliances, not in the old sense of the word, not in the sense of tough bloc discipline when NATO was against the Warsaw Pact and everyone knew that this part of the negotiating table would raise their hands and this part would vote against it. Today such baculine discipline looks humiliating to states that preach democracy, pluralism of thought, and so on... Other types of alliances – flexible network alliances – are much more in demand today.150
Indeed, Moscow has frequently sought an alliance. In October 2014 Putin said Russia and China were natural allies.151 In November 2014 Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu contended that Russia and China confront not only U.S. threats in the Asia-Pacific but also U.S.-orchestrated “color revolutions” and Islamic terrorism. Therefore, “The issue of stepping up this cooperation [between Russia and China] has never been as relevant as it is today.”152 Specifically, he advocated enhanced but unspecified bilateral Sino-Russian security cooperation and within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.153 Shoigu included not only Central Asia but also East Asia, as did Deputy Minister Anatoly Antonov. Both men decried U.S. policies that allegedly fomented color revolutions and support for Islamic terrorism in Southeast and Central Asia. Shoigu further stated that,
In the context of an unstable international situation the strengthening of goodneighborly relations between our countries acquires particular significance. This is not only a significant factor in the states’ security but also a contribution to ensuring peace throughout the Eurasian continent and beyond.154
This overture fundamentally reversed past Russian policy to exclude the Peoples’ Liberation Army from Central Asia and retain the option of military intervention exclusively for itself. It could
27

signify Russia’s growing dependence on China in Central Asia and elsewhere under mounting Western and economic pressure. Neither was it the only example of solicitation of an alliance with China. Putin recently noted that:
As we had never reached this level of relations before, our experts have had trouble defining today's general state of our common affairs. It turns out that to say we have strategic cooperation is not enough anymore. This is why we have started talking about a comprehensive partnership and strategic collaboration. “Comprehensive” means that we work virtually on all major avenues; “strategic” means that we attach enormous inter-governmental importance to this work.155
This is too close for advocacy of an alliance to be coincidental. But the alliance Moscow seeks need not be formally codified like NATO or pre-World War I alliances. Rather this alliance can remain a de facto flexible alignment with room for separate, parallel, or convergent, initiatives or even occasional disagreements in keeping with Russian views on the contemporary world order.156 This conforms to Kashin, Putin, and Lavrov’s observations on the bilateral relationship’s tendencies.157 Michael Yahuda also observes that Russian elites favor enhanced collaboration.
Moscow believes that bolstering China’s military position in East Asia is very much in Russian interests. As the official in charge of Russian arms exports stated in April 2015, “if we work in China’s interests, that means we also work in our interests.” In other words, the U.S.-led economic sanctions on Russia have made Sino-Russian strategic interests more congruent.158
More recently Shoigu remarked that,
Russia's strategic partner is the People's Republic of China. Bilateral military cooperation is developing actively. Primarily it is focused on the fight against international terrorism. Joint actions are regularly practiced during the military exercises Naval Interaction and Peaceful Mission. The Russian Federation continues to prepare specialists for the People's Liberation Army of China. In total more than 3,600 Chinese servicemen have been trained in the universities of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.159
This solution meets China’s refusal to join formal alliances and Chinese leaders’ repeated calls upon Moscow to forge ever closer ties and cooperation regarding Asian and international security, support China’s vital national interests, and even build a new world order based on “global strategic stability.”160 It also allows Putin and Xi Jinping to pretend that there is not an alliance and that Russia is expanding its ties in Asia. Yet ""Russia and China stick to points of view which are very close to each other or are almost the same in the international arena,"" Putin said, in 2016.161
Putin, since 2012, accelerated the alliance trend, making it a lodestar in his agenda. Putin, if not his colleagues, deny a potential China threat and deride that theory. They and China constantly reiterate that Russo-Chinese relations are immune to changes in world affairs and have never been better.162 This policy replaced or supplanted the previous partnership where Russia maintained a certain independence from many Chinese policies in Asia.
Since 2012 we see actual calls for an alliance and important Russian concessions after 2013 to Chinese policies and interests that Russia hitherto resisted. These reversals occur in regard to arms
28

sales, granting China equity in Russian domestic, energy, and Arctic infrastructure projects, soliciting Chinese investment, Central Asia and East Asian security issues and possibly even strategic nuclear issues pertaining to arms control. For example, Russia’s recent invitation to the U.S. to begin strategic stability talks made no mention of China, repudiating a past principle of Russia’s approach to future arms control.163
This process also includes expanded military cooperation as shown by Moscow’s invocation of Chinese support for joint naval operations in the Mediterranean in 2015 and the Baltic in 2017, and its acquiescence in exercises in the South China Sea in 2016.164 Russia’s advocacy of Chinese participation in Syria’s reconstruction also suggests Russia’s need for Chinese support for its Middle Eastern policies, an utterly unprecedented occurrence. 165 These concessions build on China’s already superior bilateral position.166 There also evidently is visible parallelism if not congruence in their policies towards Greece and Turkey though China clearly will not let Russian interests override its economic interests in Greece, Turkey or Eastern Europe generally. 167 Nevertheless East European analysts now report increasing joint Sino-Russian collaboration on economic and political projects in Central and Eastern Europe.168
It is clear from Moscow’s growing collaboration and dependence upon showing Chinese military force in the Baltic and Mediterranean and growing cooperation on large-scale investment projects, including the reconstruction of Syria that Russian power in Europe and its ability to concentrate its power resources there depend crucially on Chinese support. Therefore whether we call this an alliance or something else, the name is irrelevant for policy purposes but the reality is one of a working alliance. But it is and will likely become ever more of an alliance based on Russia’s status as a junior partner and this has to be seen at home and abroad ultimately as a sign of weakness and of the hollowness behind Russia’s great power claims.
Russian Strategic Capabilities and Goals
Russian military capabilities may be a work in progress but they are unquestionably steadily improving and have been doing so for almost a decade. Aiding this process is that Russia has used the Syrian and Ukrainian campaigns, as well as its snap exercises to conduct a “roulement” or rolling deployment of troops from all over Russia into combat to give them experience in theatrelevel war that Western and U.S. troops have not seen in a generation.169 In exercises as well, e.g. the Zapad-2017, Russian troops exercised under electronic attack, again something with which our troops are quite unfamiliar.170 These two wars, as Russian leaders endlessly reiterate, offer clues not only to future procurements but also allow Moscow not only to exercise its troops but to test a wide range of operational requirements, weapons and technologies in actual combat conditions.171
Despite visible manpower issues, Russia has demonstrated in practice its ability to concentrate and deploy forces rapidly at the key points or front line of conflicts in ways that have proven simply impossible for Western forces to achieve. These factors, with all the negative aspects of Russian forces taken into account, reveal just how difficult it will be for NATO to counter Russian escalation unless it accelerates and intensifies its comprehension of and response to current developments. As Rand Expert David Ochmanek has testified and frequently reported, Western forces would lose the initial round making escalation in a conventional theatre-wide conflict in Eastern Europe.172
29

Neither is this just a matter of conventional and electronic war. As the British analyst Keir Giles observes,
There is a parallel here with discussions of nonstrategic nuclear weapons – another field where there is intense debate as to the real quantity of Russian inventory but where quantity is of secondary importance. That is both because the available numbers far outstrip what is usable in the European theatre and because the doctrine for their use provides Russia with means of escalation or de-escalation to which Western allies have no response.173
Russian equipment also, in key niches like artillery, air defense, and electronic warfare (EW) also outstrips Western capabilities and Moscow is steadily moving to expand those capabilities beyond their present limits even as it moves forwards on new systems incorporating hypersonics, artificial intelligence (AI), robotic, lasers, UAVs and anti-UAV systems etc.174 In this context it also is of crucial importance to take into account Russia’s expansion of its naval and air base network that incorporates an ever more lethal A2AD network at low, medium, and higher altitudes based on land, sea, air, and autonomous systems.
These networks extend through the Arctic, Baltic, Ukraine, Caucasus, Central Asia, bases in Syria, upcoming bases in Egypt, potentially Yemen, Sudan, Cyprus, Libya, and even maybe Iran. These bases, replete with formidable missile-strike capabilities like the Kalibr’ cruise missile or conventional Iskander and the integrated air defense S-300, 400, and eventually 500 aim to deny the West and NATO the ability to conduct its canonical aerospace operation from Central Europe and the Mediterranean to Central Asia, creating Eurasia as a kind of secure bastion against the West.
This may be a bastion strategy writ large but if continues to cohere, as is now the case with the expansion of these capabilities and bases we could attain a situation described by Major General Morten Klever of the Royal Norwegian Air Force “with [legacy aircraft and] the new evolving systems around us, we could easily be denied access to our own air space.175
This evolving network of naval and air bases not only gives Moscow strategic leverage over the Mediterranean and Eurasia, it also affords Moscow unprecedented leverage over commercial, including energy flows, in the Mediterranean, Suez Canal, Red Sea, and even to some degree in the Persian Gulf. Thus we see Russian diplomacy which secures these bases, working in accordance with a larger strategy to deploy those capabilities to give Russia secure leverage and standing in economic and energy areas as well as military impregnability of its A2AD network against the West. Thus the military, IW, and political energies of the state are focused on the enhancement of Russia’s overall strategic capabilities and the degradation of allied strategy.
Faced with the threat of NATO/EU expansion into areas it deems its privileged sphere of influence Moscow has incited and preserved frozen conflicts from Ukraine to Syria, including Moldova and the Caucasus. This outcome both arrests the expansion of Western security organizations into the states in this zone, it also preserves many of them in Putin-like systems of corruption, autocracy, and backwardness that afford Russia ample opportunities to influence or control their destinies. Second, it has taken advantages of the failures of liberalism, especially after the 2008 financial crash, to exploit every opportunity for seducing restive populations or political movements to throw in their lot with Russia against what they perceive to be a failed liberalism, as in Hungary.
30

While Hungary is a Russian success story we find these phenomena across Europe ranging from Brexit, to Catalonia, and across the anti-integration European parties of right and left. Political ideology matters little, what is critical is willingness to accept Russian subsidies, oppose European integration and democracy and stir up the national question, in it many guises across Europe, and thus thwart democratic consolidation or expansion whether in Serbia or the UK. At all times the objectives remain the same, prevent democratic consolidation and expansion, fragment the Transatlantic Alliance, leave Europe disaggregated and Russia the strongest possible power on the continent who can do as it pleases in its ever-expanding sphere of influence, give Russia permanent leverage through information warfare and subsidies derived from energy and corruption on European governments, parties, media, and elites. Moscow has grasped that in contemporary war the new objective is not victory as such, or territorial acquisition though it hardly disdains those outcomes. Rather the real objective is regime change and even more a change in the way in which people think about political issues.176
Russia wants to rip up the established international order that has developed since 1989 and return not to a Cold War but to the status it had during the Cold War. Force alone will not suffice for Russia; thus it has to resort to what its leaders call new generation warfare to bring about this new multipolar. Russia’s strategy also takes for granted Western degeneration, and decline or at least inattention and inability to grasp what is happening and is conducted on a global scale, as our own experience in 2016 and Russian operations in places like Latin America show us. It is conducted as wartime operations and its battleground is global, including the internal structures of government here, in the UK, Germany, France, etc.
In IW, the capabilities Moscow brings to bear are universally available. But Moscow has mobilized them creatively using its own theory of IW that makes it the most critical domain of warfare and one that pervades both kinetic and non-kinetic operations. Therefore tools like media ownership, trolls, fake news, systematic disinformation, subsidizing political parties abroad, incitement of ethno-religious tensions, weaponizing refugees, etc. are conducted concurrently with kinetic operations in Syria and Ukraine and the ongoing development of an ever more powerful kinetic force to deter and intimidate neighbours and interlocutors while corrupting them from the inside.
A recent Chatham House study by Keir Giles emphasized Russia’s ability to purchase or co-opt business and political elites to create “compliant networks”, generate “agents of influence” or “Trojan horses” in foreign governments and institutions that offer Russia leverage over them.177 This is particularly notable where ethnic and/or religious cleavages furnish Russia with the means for exploiting those as is now happening with Muslim migration to Europe.178 For Russia the phenomenon of nationalism begs to be instrumentalized for the state’s benefit. In the Balkans Moscow supports the Hungarian minority against Ukraine, Serbs against Kosovo, Albania, Montenegro, and Bosnia, even to the degree of launching a coup in 2016-17 in Montenegro using Serbs.179 As a result Russia has developed a formidable range of IW capabilities. As recently described by Edward Lucas, they comprise:
• The targeted use of corruption; • Cyber-attacks on the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data held on a target
country’s computer systems;
31

• Diplomatic divide-and-rule games designed to weaken multilateral rule-based organizations and to create the perception of the targeted country’s isolation and indefensibility;
• The exploitation of economic, ethnic, linguistic, regional, religious, social and other divisions;
• Economic sanctions such as import curbs and restrictions on exports and transit; • Interference with energy supplies, especially natural gas; • Stoking financial panics; • Weaponizing history to besmirch the reputation of a target country and hide Kremlin
crimes; • Covert information operations such as the hacking and leaking attacks seen in the U.S. and
French presidential elections; • Abuse of the international legal system, such as issuing Interpol Red Notices to critics,
mounting libel actions and vexatious lawsuits; • Military bluffing and saber-rattling; • Irregular and regular warfare; • The use of organized crime networks to demoralize decision-makers and public opinion; • Overt and covert payments to buy influence in political parties, think tanks, media outlets
and academic institutions; • Physical intimidation of opponents and critics; • Psychological warfare on an individual and collective basis; • The exploitation of religious sentiment, especially among Orthodox believers; • Physical sabotage of critical infrastructure; • The targeted use of social media to affect public opinion; • Subversion of social norms, public confidence and state institutions; and • Support for violent anti-social behavior.180
Furthermore,
To complicate matters further, these tactics are not applied in a static or even linear formation. Russia’s spymasters are not stupid. They develop new approaches, especially new combinations and sequences of tactics, tweaking them based on what works and what doesn’t. We think we are looking at a picture; our adversaries are writing a screenplay.181
Ultimately of course, the deployment of these capabilities aims at the permanent destabilization of its neighbors and rivals and the acquisition thereby of a free hand at home and abroad. Concurrently, Susan Stewart of the Stiftung Wissenschaft Und Politik in Germany writes that,
Russia is more than willing to tolerate instability and economic weakness in the neighboring countries, assuming they are accompanied by an increase in Russian influence. In fact, Russia consciously contributes to the rising instability and deterioration of the economic situation in some, if not all, of these countries.182
32

Russian Military Capabilities Where Moscow Possesses A Comparative Advantage
To redefine the geopolitical status quo and the post-Cold War settlement Russia has created many formidable capabilities though they have their shortcomings as well. What might be called the new Russian way of war has highlighted these capabilities and revealed the extent to which Moscow may use them in present and future conflicts. Before moving onto a discussion of those capabilities where Moscow possesses a comparative advantage vis-à-vis potential adversaries we need to understand that what makes for this advantage is not necessarily the technological quality of these weapons even though some areas like anti-ship missile and boosters or artillery in general are traditional centers of excellence.
Rather what is critical is that Moscow has embarked upon a never-ending process of rethinking contemporary warfare and its strategic-operational, tactical requirements to defeat the U.S. and lesser threats and is shaping its forces accordingly. In other words the innovative concepts married to technologies, including new ones and weapons to come based on “new physical principles” is what makes its military and information capabilities so lethal. If anything Moscow has thought more seriously about contemporary warfare than have its Western adversaries many of whom still prefer like ostriches to keep their head in the sand.
Therefore superior technology, economies and manpower bases do not assure victory if strategic thinking and aptitude are lacking which is still too often the case. Moreover, Russia’s political system places few if any inhibitions or barriers to the unceasing use of any and all of its instruments of power so that it can deploy its non-kinetic energy, economic, and information capabilities at all times in a threatening way.
In this context the areas where Russia has displayed a comparative advantage include paramilitary and regular military forces as well as cyber and IW capabilities that have now received extensive scrutiny. These go along with Moscow’s nuclear, space and non-kinetic capabilities like its diplomacy and economic and organized criminal influence abroad. In addition these non-kinetic capabilities comprise not just pro-Russian elements abroad but those segments of the Russian diaspora who can be utilized willingly or unwittingly to advance Russian strategic interests. Moreover, as in so many instances of Russian history, Moscow has applied what it believes it has learned from the West to advance its interests. One particular example is the use of private or paramilitary organizations, in the former case derived from the Blackwater and other such cases, to perform combat or combat support activities for Moscow.
Paramilitary Forces
Beyond the private Wagner and other such forces described below we must also take into account paramilitary forces. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen strongman, has raised and commands an army of 40,000 battle-hardened and well-armed men loyal to Putin outside of the Russian army. He offered to use them in Ukraine and Chechens fought there for Russia. But since then there has been talk of using them in Afghanistan or Central Asia against terrorists and they are now being used in Syria as military police. Indeed, Kadyrov announced his willingness to send Chechens to perform special military missions for Putin that other organizations of the Russian forces cannot perform, such as in Ukraine or as Putin’s palace guard, or perhaps in Central Asia.183
33

The Chechen forces, because they are Muslims, enable Moscow to use Muslims to police other Muslims at home and abroad in keeping with long-standing tendencies in Russian imperial management.184 But they also provide Moscow with a formidable force outside the regular state administration that is wholly loyal to Putin. In this regard they are parallels to the plethora of paramilitary groups within Russia that have emerged within the Ministry of Interior after 2005 whose mission is simply protection of Putin and/or the government.185
These forces have since continued to exist alongside of the regular state police and military forces but many of them have since been amalgamated into the Russian National Guard, though the Guard’s main function is to protect Putin and/or the government. Despite its primarily domestic mandate the Guard has conducted joint anti-terrorist drills with the Chinese armed police and have been licensed to conduct foreign peacekeeping operations.186 So there is also no doubt that this force of about 400,000 people across Russia could easily be mobilized if the need arose.
Moscow has also resorted to drafting members of the Russian diaspora in the Donbass under supposedly retired or no longer active Russian army officers. It is well known that they had to be rescued by regular army units in 2014-15, and since then have been reborn as trained and essentially integrated members of the Russian army with Russian commanders and fire support. Were Moscow to invade the Baltic there is little doubt it would attempt to repeat this experiment, albeit more successfully if possible.
In its preparations for Ukraine, Moscow used the services and wealth of the Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeev to recruit and finance “volunteers” for action in Ukraine. Malofeev may also have helped inspire the actual strategy used in seizing Crimea.187 And Malofeev, along with other oligarchs, has been linked to efforts to subvert the Polish government.188 Malofeev also links up to other semi-public “political entrepreneurs” who either organize, bankroll, or incite the formation of links between right-wing political parties, the Orthodox Church, media outlets civic and political figures and parties in the Balkans inter alia.189
This tactic allows Moscow to establish linkages not only with right-wing political parties but with shadowy right-wing paramilitary groups. For example in Hungary GRU members have conducted ties with the right-wing Hungarian Army MNA funnelling arms and ammunition to them.
This kind of evolving liaison between the neo-Nazi MNA, its media and Kremlin figures fits perfectly into the Kremlin’s increasingly decentralized post-Crimea disinformation operation in Central Eastern Europe based on locally operated pro-Russian new media platforms embedded into extremist political subcultures, usually espousing extreme right and extreme left ideologies, their numbers running in the hundreds in the region and around 100 in Hungary alone.190
Russia’s intervention in Syria also highlights the ability to use the Western technique of private contractors for state objectives. In Syria thousands of private contractors called Wagner are fighting for Russia since September 2015 when Moscow first intervened there.191 This private army has also seen action in Ukraine receiving about 120,000/month there ($2000). According to Ukrainian sources it comprised 2000-5000 men in Ukraine who were well-trained professional soldiers as well as tanks, howitzers and multiple launch rocket systems.
34

Apparently they answer only to another oligarch, Evgeny Prigozhin, Putin’s restaurant guru and food supplier to the Russian army. Reportedly in Syria there are about 3-4000 such forces.192 The forces involved with Wagner and other such groups first fought in Yugoslavia’s wars in the 1990s and then Chechnya and since then Ukraine and now Syria.193 Wagner has also fought and taken substantial casualties in Syria.
The advantage of such groups is that they allow Putin not only to impose his order at home but also abroad using professional soldiers, diaspora figures, mercenaries and Chechens with considerable plausible deniability and in many cases at someone else’s expense, i.e. oligarchs. These forces are particularly useful, for the most part in grey area contingencies and smaller wars or as supplements to Russian regular forces who can be seeded among them to command and train them but who can hide among them allowing the government to deny its presence.
They also can perform major combat support operations or be used as private mercenary forces that can be “rented out” to friendly foreign governments under threat. This actually appears to have been the case regarding the Wagner forces in Syria before 2015.194 Therefore it is unlikely that we have seen the end of the use of such forces by Moscow.
In fact there are recent reports suggesting that they may play a bigger role in future contingencies.195 In 2012 Putin said that such companies implement national interests without the direct involvement of the state and should be utilized.196 By contracting out requirements for such forces Putin, can, in areas where scarce specialities are needed, e.g. foreign languages, recruit forces who offer some professionalism, subservience to Moscow and plausible deniability at reduced cost in money and casualties to the regular forces.
Moscow can also hide its hand behind these forces and minimize its public exposure. Since the use of such forces like the Wagner firm began in 2013 they have not only appeared in Ukraine and Syria, but there are also now reports of their presence in Libya. Moreover in Syria Moscow is apparently granting oil and mining rights in Syria to private military contractors that secure territory from extremists thereby melding business and state interest for these firms and the central government.197
These private armies are kinetic analogues to the thousands of trolls Moscow employs at home and abroad to conduct its IW campaigns. We also know of private and organized crime groups like the Russian Business Network (RBN) who were instrumental in the Georgia and Estonian IW campaigns in 2007-08. It is worth emphasizing that in Estonia and in subsequent manifestations of IW and IO, the Russian government has cooperated with organized crime structures like RBN to launch attacks. According to researchers Eli Jellenc and Kimberly Zenz:
RBN is a cyber crime organization that ran an internet service provider (ISP) until 2007 and continues to be heavily involved in cyber crime such as phishing, malware distribution, malicious code, botnet command and control, DDOS attacks, and child pornography. Though the most recent structure of RBN began in 2005, there are rumors that date RBN (as an unofficial group of cyber criminals) back to 1996.
In 2002, the group became more structured and more active. It was accused of attacking the United States Department of Defense and the Russian Department of the Treasury in
35

2003, though none of this can be proven officially. While it is not certain that RBN is directly connected to the Russian mafia, it is highly likely. RBN is heavily involved in child pornography, which is traditionally controlled by the Russian mafia, and its official leader, who goes by the alias “Flyman,” is suspected of running those operations (and of possibly being a pedophile himself).
It is also known that Flyman has family connections to the government: his father or uncle was involved in politics in St. Petersburg before taking an important position at a ministry in Moscow. Another RBN member, Aleksandr Boykov, is a former lieutenant colonel in the Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti (FSB, the successor agency to the KGB). While it is currently not possible to prove that RBN has worked in tandem with the FSB or other security services (collectively, the Siloviki), it is likely that they are at least connected.
When RBN officially hosted Internet services between early 2006 and November 2007, it was linked to 60 percent of all cyber crime. Due to increased pressure (including blocking and blacklisting of RBN IP addresses and domains) from the cyber security industry and increased attention in published reports and news articles, RBN attempted to restructure itself in October 2007, concealing its affiliations with a variety of IPs. When this failed, it deleted a number of its domains and shut down, moving to Chinese and Taiwanese networks on November 6, 2007. This failed to divert attention, however, and two days later, it ceased routing traffic and its networks.
However, it would be incorrect to say that RBN no longer exists or even that it has disbanded. While it no longer runs an ISP, the group appears to be active still and harder to track on a much more disbursed level across a variety of mostly legitimate ISPs. In general, Russian cyber crime certainly has not decreased with the end of RBN’s ISP. Instead, it continues to grow, spread across a variety of ISPs and domains, and in February 2008, Russia surpassed China as the largest generator of malware, with 27.9 percent compared to China’s 26.5 percent (the United States is a distant third at 9.98 percent). Cybersecurity experts continue to use the term “RBN” to refer to the loosely organized group of cyber criminals based in Russia, and cyber activity and crime by this group continue to remain high. 198
Inasmuch as the RBN is still in business it embodies not only the use of seemingly private entities for state military purposes abroad it also epitomizes the utter criminality of the Putin regime which rules Russia like a mafia thinks and acts accordingly. Thus the RBN and the trolls reflect part of Moscow’s comparative advantages in IW and in smaller-scale conventional contingencies.
Information Warfare
Russia’s assault upon the entire Western information space, both civilian and military may be the most important weapon in its arsenal and the one where it has clearly garnered a comparative advantage. It is not technical sophistication but innovative conceptualization of the battlefield that has expanded to include the entire socio-political arena and the willingness to throw resources at it on a constant basis is the enabling factor here along with Western neglect. This is not merely buying up media in Europe or elsewhere though media ownership certainly is an important part of
36

this arsenal. Instead it is the concept that military-political goals can be achieved solely or primarily over time by the application of Russia’s concept of information warfare.
There is no real distinction in Moscow’s concept of information confrontation between attacking cyber networks like civilian power grids and networks, or attacking military ones such as spacebased and civilian ISR networks, or the saturation of the social and other media spaces with proRussian narratives. These are all part of the same process and aim to inhibit or paralyze enemy military action and, if possible, to bring about an internal capitulation of the target from within over time. IW is used without letup in both peace and war indicating Moscow’s permanent perception of being at war. It is broad-gauged aiming to insert its narrative and sow doubt on Western policies and values at all times thereby creating a sizable bloc of people who will not accept their own government’s account of contemporary strategic phenomena even if they are not supporters of Russia.
By utilizing useful idiots as well as the willing and credulous, Moscow seeks to maintain permanent pressure on targeted states and can implement this weapon in doing so because of its well-known advantages. Those are the relative cheapness of cost, and the difficulties in attribution of the sources of information attacks and operations (IOs). Moscow also readily exploits the freedoms of Western societies to insert its channels of communication and then hides behind these freedoms precisely to subvert them and Western governments. So apart from its ability to exploit Western freedoms, the easiness of entry into IW and the difficulties of attribution, Moscow’s main advantage stems from its consistency in waging this kind of war because its reconceptualization of its current strategic position and of contemporary warfare leads it to look for imaginative workarounds or surrogates for military force in challenging the West from an inferior position.
The upshot is that it can place entire societies in a state of permanent psychological apprehension solely through the application of these informational and political warfare instruments. Contemporary American politics attests to the success of this maneuver but it is hardly only happening here. A 2009 assessment of Russian policy in Latvia concluded,
We see several, interrelated short-term [Russian] strategies focusing on exercising everincreasing influence in the politics of the target states. What we do not see is a policy of military conquest but, rather, a gradual but unswerving drive to eventually regain dominance over the social, economic, and political affairs of what are to become entirely dependent client states.199
A more recent article observed that,
The idea that Moscow could intervene in the Baltic states on the basis of alleged discrimination against Russian-speakers has been a fundamental feature of Moscow’s Baltic policy. Several studies have explored the motivations, mechanisms and organizations involved in carrying out Russia’s compatriot policy as well as its direct impact on ethnopolitics and minority mobilization in Estonia and Latvia.200
To this end, Moscow has long since created multiple organizations of diaspora and informational mechanism to keep the pressure constantly on the Baltic States.201 Furthermore it is clear that by keeping these states under pressure Moscow, as seen in its exercises and deployments, keeps the
37

options of invading them or precipitating their collapse as a central strategic objective for Russian planners have realized since 1935 if not earlier that without occupation of the Baltic coast, Russia would be hard pressed to defend against an invasion from the West which it continues to expect.202
Conventional Warfare
This consideration leads us to assess the advantages Moscow might possess in a conventional war in Eastern Europe. Undoubtedly it still retains operational superiority; the Zapad-2017 exercise confirms that it will continue to refine its ability to deliver rapidly lethal force packages to those theaters from the Baltic to the Black Sea, and possibly the Arctic as well. Although NATO’s capabilities in Poland and the Baltic states as well as the Black Sea are growing, so too are Moscow’s as is the quality of both sets of forces. And given the sluggishness with which Europe has reacted to the present crisis, it is clear that Moscow’s geographical advantage of proximity to the theater will remain.
In this context Moscow disposes of certain strong comparative advantages, particularly in air defense or the creation of an A2AD capability, that comprises anti-air and anti-ship capabilities in layered, combined arms, and integrated networks or an IADS, artillery, and EW. Once again these “niches of excellence” derive from both Russian historical tradition and equally form the reconceptualization of what Russia must do to deny the West, and particularly the U.S. its preferred mode of operation, namely long-range precision strike by an integrated aerospace operation in the form of Offensive Counter Air operation. This is what the Russian military observed in Operation Desert Storm and Kosovo and they have long since taken Kosovo as a template for a potential future attack on Russia. As Celeste Wallander wrote at the time, Kosovo presented the following negative assessments of NATO enlargement:
For Russia, all the hypothetical security concerns of the past decade are the threats of today. NATO is now closer to Russian borders, and is bombing a non-NATO state. Even before NATO’s new strategic concept, the Alliance’s development of Combined Joint Task Forces offered ways for the alliance to employ forces outside the constraints of Article 5 (self-defense).
NATO’s changes, combined with its determination to use force against nonmembers threatens Russia because political turmoil in the former Soviet Union increases the likelihood of NATO involvement near and perhaps even in Russia. Moscow has long feared that expansion of the Alliance could radicalize or destabilize neighboring countries, sparking internal splits or civil wars that could drag in Russia—a role it neither wants nor can afford.
Unfortunately, NATO-Russia cooperation failed to address these concerns even before Kosovo. After Kosovo, it is difficult to see what kind of cooperative relationship NATO and Russia can have. For one thing, the air strikes, as viewed from Russia, violated several principles of the NATO-Russia Founding Act—primarily NATO’s commitments to limit its right to use force and promising the settlement of disputes by peaceful means.
Russians interpret the ongoing military campaign absent U.N. Security Council approval as NATO’s drive for unilateral security in Europe. NATO’s new Strategic Concept adopted
38

at the 50th anniversary expanded the Alliance’s mission to include non-NATO Europe as a potential area for further NATO use of force. While the Concept recognizes the role of the U.N. Security Council, it does not require that NATO obtain U.N. mandate for actions beyond the Alliance’s border.203
Accordingly the main military threat is the integrated aerospace operation with conventional highprecision weapons to knock out Russian air defenses, C3I and nuclear capability, leaving the country defenseless to aerial and subsequent missile, naval and ground operations.204 The result is what scholars have called the IADS. This network exhibits the Russian interest in joint operations and builds upon Soviet thinking and experience plus new technologies and insights about post 1990-Western operations to create a comprehensive network ranging from the sea and ground to space to deny the West the capability to conduct precisions strike at short-range or long-range. It takes a page out of Sun Tzu’s recommendation to target the adversary’s strategy, for Moscow knows NATO relied precisely upon this kind of operation to establish superiority in the theater.
Russian air defenses will also integrate EW and anti-satellite weapons, which Moscow is now building, apparently in collaboration with China to degrade allied communications and ISR.205
Russian writings on the conduct of operations and tactical engagements emphasize the importance of the long-range fires contest. Russia’s military can employ overwhelming firepower against any of the country’s neighbors, and Russia has invested heavily in ISR capabilities to mass fires quickly and effectively. Russia’s strategic, operational, and tactical air defenses would pose challenges to its adversaries’ air operations and joint airground integration.
Russian ground forces are typically heavily defended with air defense systems rather than by air support; in a situation of mutual air denial, Russian ground units would most likely be a substantial advantage derived from their numerical superiority in ground-based fire support.206 Again Russian views are consistent. They believe the advantage in modern warfare goes to the side that can gain and sustain fire superiority over the adversary, and in some scenarios they would likely feel compelled to attack to secure that advantage.207
The anti-air operation has discernible features.
Russian forces would aim to disorient the adversary and prevent it from operating in its preferred fashion. Many of their efforts – including the emphasis on deception, electronic warfare, and strikes against command and communications – are intended to disrupt adversaries and slow their ability to respond to developments on the battlefield. This plays into the Russian emphasis on layered air defense and ground-based fires.
The combination of a layered IADS and a variety of ground-based indirect fire systems is intended to pose a significant joint and combined arms-integration challenge to adversaries. The IADS complicates the ability of an adversary to employ air-delivered fires against Russian forces, and the considerable artillery and missile forces available are intended to allow Russia to gain and leverage superiority in fires on the ground.208
Inasmuch as Allied pilots have experienced nothing like Russia’s IADS or EW in the last decade and a half and Russia is constantly refining the lessons it has learned in Ukraine and Syria, it is
39

clear that Western concepts of future combat and forces are either out of date or at risk from Russia’s capabilities that are acknowledged to outstrip Western EW capabilities.209
We should not think that this anti-air operation and IADS only applies to ground combat or the Baltic. Russia is doing the same thing in regards to naval warfare; its diplomacy and military operations in Syria are intended to extend the perimeters of this IADS to deny NATO access to the Black Sea and to contest the Eastern Mediterranean. The recent announcements about Russian air and naval bases in Egypt and Sudan impel us to realize that across the Middle East and Eurasia, the Russian Federation pursues a deliberate strategy to negate Western military capabilities while ensuring the expansion of Russian power in all its forms.
These recent announcements about an agreement to share air space in each country, the acquisition of an air base in Egypt and the concurrent discussions with Sudan for a naval base on the Red Sea coast highlight the range of Moscow’s objectives, the capabilities it can increasingly bring to bear in pursuit of those goals and conversely Western strategic failure.210 Air bases in Egypt and the use of Egyptian air space, along with a projected use of a Sudanese base on the Red Sea coast, allows Russia to expand its A2AD bubbles from the Arctic, Baltic, and Black Seas, the Caucasus and Central Asia regions into the Middle East. It now has naval and air bases in Syria and is angling for another naval base in Egypt; while potentially seeking access to naval facilities and naval and air bases at Cyprus, Libya, and Yemen; and it already has potential access to a base in Iran.
Moscow will undoubtedly use its Egyptian air base to strike at anti-Russian factions backed by the West in Libya. For the first time, it now has direct reconnaissance over Israeli air space and increasing leverage through its Egyptian and Syrian air bases on Israel, something Israel has sought to reject since its inception as a state. In addition to the projected base in Sudan, Russia now has the capability to strike at Saudi targets as well.
But the dimensions of Moscow’s achievement go further. These bases register Russian military and political influence throughout the region. Moscow will now have strike and/or ISR capabilities across the entire Middle East. In practical terms this means that the bases in Syria, Egypt, and probably in Iran give it the capability to project power across the entire breadth and length of the Middle East. Meanwhile, Russia will probably deploy its fire-strike weapons and integrated air defenses across these bases.
Should Moscow outfit these naval and air bases with UAV, UCAV, UUV, EW, and ISTAR capabilities and long-range cruise missiles, as is likely, Russia could then contest Western aerospace superiority throughout the atmosphere over these areas. Moscow would be able to contest the entire Eastern Mediterranean. With the ability to contest the entire Mediterranean, Moscow will place NATO land, air, and/or naval forces at risk.
The bases in Sudan and Egypt will also have a similar effect in regards to the Suez Canal and Red Sea if not the Persian Gulf’s western reaches. Meanwhile Moscow probably still has the potential to recover the use of an Iranian base as it had at Hamdan and is seeking another one in Yemen as it had in Soviet times at Socotra. If those new bases come into play and Moscow can deploy its long-range strike capabilities and integrated air defense network there as it has done at its already existing bases, then it will have coverage of the Mediterranean, Black Sea, Caucasus, and Central
40

Asia that would make any Western operation in any of those theaters extremely hazardous and costly.
Given the existing bases in the Black Sea, Caucasus, and the Levant, Turkey is already almost totally surrounded, and Balkan states and Italy could be vulnerable as well. Russia is attempting to create what Marshal Ogarkov once called a “reconnaissance-strike complex” across the Mediterranean, Red Sea, Suez Canal, Caucasus, Central Asia and the Persian Gulf. This is not only an issue of challenging the West’s reliance on an aerospace precision-fire strike in the first days of any war and thus Western and American air superiority. These capabilities also threaten international energy supplies because Moscow can then use the threat of its naval and/or air power in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Suez Canal, and Mediterranean to interdict or curtail energy supplies that traverse these waterways.
Moscow’s investment in EW is also growing and it may become a separate force within the Russian military if its commanders get their way.211 Russian commanders see EW as a reasonably cheap investment compared to the cost of other weapons systems that is nonetheless a force multiplier for degrading enemy C4ISR and participating in the anti-air operation. EW is increasingly fully integrated into operations and an independent EW brigade was created in 2009 signaling that likely trend towards more such formations over time. Moreover,
Russia is actively developing a “total package” of EW systems to include a broad frequency range and other systems: these seem advanced and capable. In addition to such systems covering surveillance, protection, and countermeasures they cover measures to protect Russia’s own usage of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The systems also offer countermeasures against “Western” civilian and magnetic usage of the EMS. Many of these Russian EW systems are highly mobile, including small systems deployable by UAVs, making targeting and neutralizing them more complex and challenging.212
Given Russian superiority in ground forces and artillery – a traditional strength – through massed indirect fires by ground, air, and naval-based systems, it is clear that NATO at present would be hard pressed to defend the Baltic and even possibly the Balkans or Eastern Mediterranean in the initial phases of a war.213
This is not an exaggeration. A recent analysis of the battles fought by the Russian army against Ukraine in 2014-15 before the Minsk II accords were signed suggests that the Russians, especially at the battle of Zelenopillya, “have broken the code on reconnaissance-strike complex, at least at the tactical and operational level.”214 This battle highlighted Russian proficiency in the tactical employment of EW and cyber attacks and integrating those forms of warfare with conventional targeting capabilities to enhance the latter. Furthermore Russia spurned the use of joint forces thereby quickening the pace between reconnaissance and fire strikes and they also demonstrated that Russia preferred intense area fire coverage rather than precisions strikes.215
Russia’s tactical, operational, and strategic innovations and the dynamic synergies they provide for Moscow are also tied to the dynamic process of rethinking contemporary war carried out by the General Staff and Ministry of Defense under centralized political leadership and “hot” production lines. They highlight the importance of the unity of theory and practice in Russian
41

defense strategy and policy and stand as glaring contrasts to Western confusion, which betrays the lack of this unity of theory and practice.216 Thus,
Russia has woven its political and military objectives together and is utilizing all of the instruments of national power to pursue those objectives. At the operational level, Russia is blending the use of force into a multi-domain approach that uses conventional, unconventional, cyber, information, and electronic warfare in a synergistic effort to overwhelm an opponent’s capacity to handle the quantity of presented dilemmas. At the tactical level, Russia has reorganized its ground forces into robust, highly integrated combined arms formations capable of finding the opponent, bringing vast amounts of firepower to bear in time and space to pulverize the opponent, and then rapidly exploit with conventional ground forces.217
When one juxtaposes these ground forces developments with what we now see transpiring in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East with regard to a naval closed sea, we begin to see the full meaning of A2AD strategies and the operational costs that await NATO unless it starts thinking better and deploying credible forces in both number and quality to support a strong strategy, theory of victory, and operational art. Indeed, if Russia or other adversaries’ kinetic and non-kinetic capabilities are functioning synergistically at the strategic level, even if it is latent of kinetic means can suffice to check a strategic superior power from considering entering into the adversary’s strategic space. Or as Sam Tangredi writes, “Using nonkinetic means, the anti-access force potentially can check the strategically superior power. That is what anti-access strategies are all about.”218 Moreover, Russia’s approach to nuclear weapons further aggravates our problems.
Nuclear Weapons and Nuclear War
Although Russia does not have an advantage in the nature of nuclear weapons even though it is modernizing its arsenal and has broken virtually every arms control treaty in existence, the real advantage it has is in the innovations which have married thought to procurement and deployment and the ensuing nuclear element of its overall strategy. As Dmitry Adamsky observes, “The nuclear component is an inseparable part of Russian operational art that cannot be analyzed as a stand-alone issue”. This is because it abets Russian conventional threats and aggression through the deterrence of adversaries’ counteraction to that aggression.219 Similarly, Major Amos Fox writes that the strategic defense provided by Russian nuclear weapons and the IADS facilitate the attainment of all of Russia’s conventional warfare objectives: deterring NATO expansion into Russia’s historic sphere of influence, retaining regional hegemony in Eurasia and demonstrating improvements to Russian military capabilities.220 That much is obvious. But beyond that,
The presence of nuclear weapons is perhaps the first critical component for modern hybrid warfare. Nuclear weapons provide insurance against a massive ground response to an incremental limited war. The offensive nation that possesses nuclear weapons knows that the adversary or its allies will not likely commit large ground forces to a conflict for fear of the aggressor employing those weapons against ground [or naval-SB] forces. This dynamic emboldens the aggressor nation. In the case of Russia, its possession of nuclear weapons emboldens leaders to take offensive action because they know that even the threat of nuclear employment forces potential adversaries to a standstill.221
42

We see this coming true in Moscow’s behavior and apparent nuclear strategy. This is because the document detailing that strategy and conditions for nuclear use is classified and its doctrinal statements are hardly revealing. To say that nuclear weapons might be used in a first strike if there is a vital threat to the state’s survival is hardly revelatory for any nuclear power, especially one haunted by the real spectre of state disintegration and who cannot afford to lose any war that it engages in. But Russia’s “nuclear behaviour” is sufficient grounds for real anxiety. As Colin Gray observes, despite the fact that there is no sign of Russian discourse coming true concerning the use of a nuclear weapon to defeat NATO in limited nuclear scenarios, Moscow talks as if it can achieve this outcome. Thus he writes,
In a manner that is ominously reminiscent of Adolf Hitler, Putin and others have chosen to introduce explicitly ruthless threats, including nuclear threats, into Russian reasoning about acute international crises. They hypothesize about the high political value that would accrue as a result of nuclear use on a limited scale. The hoop, apparently, is that the NATO enemy, certainly the less robust members, at least, would be out-gunned either by the actuality, or more likely only by the credible threat of nuclear.222
Not surprisingly, for Gray the inescapable conclusion is that Russia seeks escalation dominance.
In the language of now-classic strategic theory from a past generation of theorists, the Russians currently are talking with apparent seriousness about nuclear escalation dominance. Russian theorists claim, perhaps expect, they could win a war wherein Russia employs nuclear weapons on a very modest scale. This expectation follows from a Russian belief that Moscow’s employment of a few nuclear weapons would give them a decisive coercive edge in the diplomacy that should follow. Russian authors have advised us ironically that the use of these weapons would prove to be a decisive de-escalatory move – de-escalatory because NATO would be expected to capitulate. The high determination shown unmistakably by the fact of Russian nuclear use would surprise, even shock, audiences politically around the world. Thus with unmatched boldness Russia should achieve a considerable political, perhaps even military, victory.223
While no such scenario has yet occurred nor is it immediately likely it does show not just the brazenness but equally, if not more importantly, it shows how nuclear scenarios are intertwined with conventional wars. Arguably there is a seamless web from conventional scenarios leading up to and including supposedly limited nuclear war scenarios perhaps using tactical nuclear weapons for which the West as yet has found no response. 224 Or as Finnish LTC Pertti Forsstrom argues,
In this way the content of traditional strategic deterrence is broadened to cover both Russian nuclear and conventional assets. On the other hand, the abolishment of the restrictions for the use of nuclear weapons means that the dividing line between waging war with conventional or with nuclear weapons is vanishing. When the principle of surprise is connected to this idea, it seems that Russia wants to indicate that non-strategic nuclear weapons could be regarded as “normal” assets on a conventional battlefield. This is the basis upon which Russia regulates the level of deterrence for example in the Kaliningrad exclave. By introducing the concept of pre-emptive strike to its military means, Russia is trying to enhance its non-nuclear deterrence even further.225
43

And when one looks at Russian nuclear procurement in the present and as intended through 2025 if not later than this inextricability of nuclear weapons with Russia’s war strategy becomes even clearer.
Nuclear weapons represent important, even critical, parts of Putin’s so called asymmetric or indirect strategy and of what U.S. analysts call Putin’s hybrid war strategy. Their continuing procurement is unceasing. These sectors are critical not only because they are procurement priorities but also because until recently Russia clearly envisaged fighting a limited nuclear war and may still think in terms of doing so.
It is true that Russia’s most recent military doctrines suggest a move towards greater reliance on what might be called non-nuclear or conventional deterrence.226 But its procurement programs and exercises like the recent Zapad-2017 exercise point to an entirely different conclusion, namely anticipation of actual nuclear war-fighting. Therefore the controversy over the role of nuclear weapons in Russian strategy and the question of whether or not Russia has a high or low threshold for nuclear use remains unresolved.227
Nevertheless the worst aspect of these deployments and plans is that they highlight the General Staff and government’s strategy as still being one of supposedly limited nuclear war. Previously key officials confirmed this interpretation, conceding limited nuclear war as Russia’s officially acknowledged strategy against many different kinds of contingencies.228 The correspondent Ilya Kedrov, in his 2010 discussion of armored vehicles, also ratified his understanding of the doctrine as affirming this strategy.229 Likewise, Colonel-General Nikolai Solovtsov, Commander in Chief of the Strategic Missile (Rocket) Forces, stated in 2008 that new military uses for nuclear weapons are coming into being. Thus,
The radical changes that have occurred since the end of the Cold War in international relations and the considerable reduction of the threat that a large-scale war, even more so a nuclear one, could be unleashed, have contributed to the fact that in the system of views on the role of nuclear arms both in Russia and the U.S, a political rather than military function has begun to prevail. In relation to this, besides the traditional forms and methods in the combat use of the RVSN, a new notion of “special actions” by the groupings of strategic offensive arms has emerged. Such actions mean the RVSN’s containment actions, their aim to prevent the escalation of a high-intensity non-nuclear military conflict against the Russian Federation and its allies.230
At a September 2008 roundtable on nuclear deterrence, Solovtsov noted that Russia was giving explicit consideration to the concept of “special actions” or “deterring actions of the RVSN aimed at the prevention of escalation of a non-nuclear military conflict of high intensity against Russia.” Solovtsov further stated that,
These actions may be taken with a view to convincingly demonstrate to the aggressor [the] high combat potential of Russian nuclear missile weapons, [the] determination of the military-political leadership of Russia to apply them in order to make the aggressor stop combat actions In view of its unique properties, the striking power of the Strategic Missile Forces is most efficient and convincing in the de-escalation actions. 231
44

Whatever changes have occurred since then in actual operational planning, nuclear weapons remain Russia’s priority procurement program item and new models are being developed with hypersonic capabilities even as Russia is also modernizing older systems. And the extent of these programs far outstrips current U.S. modernization. 232 Indeed, Russian officials, e.g. Viktor Bondarev, head of the Federation Council Defense and Security Committee, not only see no threat from recent U.S. nuclear exercises, but Bondarev actually claims that “Russia's nuclear potential is significantly superior to America's.""233
Since the late 1990s, Russia has developed and deployed: two new types of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), including a new road-mobile missile and a silo-based variant (Topol-M Variant 2 and Yars); a new type of sea-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), the Bulava-30, and two upgraded versions of an existing SLBM (Sineva and Liner); a new class of ballistic missile submarine (Borey); modernized heavy bombers, including the Tu160 (Blackjack) and Tu-95 (Bear); and a new long-range strategic cruise missile (Raduga). Russia is also developing additional strategic nuclear weapons systems, including: a new road-mobile ICBM (Rubezh) and a new rail-mobile ICBM (Barguzin); a new heavy ICBM (Sarmat) with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs); a new “fifth generation” missile submarine to carry ballistic and cruise missiles; and a new stealthy heavy bomber to carry cruise missiles and reportedly hypersonic missiles.234
Despite Moscow’s professed interest in new arms control treaties, this is not the program of a state seeking disarmament. Furthermore Moscow has long sought and is continuing to test weapons whose explicit purpose is to evade U.S. missile defenses which it continues to regard, in defiance of all science and innumerable Western briefings, as a major threat to its second-strike capability. In September 2017 Moscow tested both the road-mobile and silo-based versions of the RS-24 Yars solid-fuel ICBM in conjunction with the Zapad-2017 exercises, using “experimental warheads.”235
In addition, Russia has recently announced that it will soon test a new generation of ICBMs that “can beat US defense systems” and hold the U.S. and Europe at risk. The new Sarmat, or Satan-2, RS-28 ICBM can allegedly destroy an area the size of Texas or France, evade missile defenses and do so using hypersonic Multiple Independent Reentry Vehicles that are now permitted under the New START treaty. The hypersonic missiles that allegedly can be fitted to this system are currently in development under the title Project 4202, a label that evidently refers to the hypersonic glide vehicle, the Yu-71.236 Russian sources claim an 11,000 kilometers range and up to 15 warheads for this weapon, a yield of up to 760 kilotons and the building of launch silos that could withstand seven nuclear strikes.237
Russian nuclear modernization programs also encompass all three legs of its triad of air, sea, and land-based nuclear weapons as well as short, intermediate, and long-range nuclear weapons. According to General Paul Selva, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Russia is also developing new tactical nuclear weapons. 238 Thus it can tailor its forces to any number of contingencies. And that is only one of over 20 Russian programs currently underway to manufacture and deploy nuclear weapons. These include a heavy ICBM, new bombers and new SLBMS and missile submarines.239 In addition, in October 2017 Putin took the unusual step of publicly announcing his personal participation in a nuclear exercise using all three elements of Russia’s nuclear triad and some of the newest models of Russian air, land and sea-launched nuclear weapons.240
45

Putin also highlighted Russia’s ongoing militarization by announcing that over 2,500 military exercises had occurred in 2017.241 Moreover, given current procurement plans and the counting rules under the New START Treaty Russia could actually increase its nuclear weapons and still be in compliance.242 Finally, all conventional plans and exercises have an accompanying nuclear component, so nuclear options are integrated into operational plans and rehearsed beforehand. Submarine-based nuclear strikes from the Arctic accompanied the recent Zapad 2017 exercises as did much less heralded nuclear exercises in Novosibirsk involving some of the newest nuclear weapons in Moscow’s arsenal. 243 And this followed a pattern of coinciding nuclear and conventional exercises for Zapad 2009 and 2013.244
Thus we can safely say that Russia’s concept and program for nuclear weapons presents it with an apparent advantage over the U.S. As Mark Schneider writes,
Contrary to popular belief, the United States does not enjoy nuclear parity with Russia. In fact, Russia has nuclear superiority. The illusion of nuclear parity is created by: 1) comparing the Russian active stockpile with the U.S. active and inactive stockpiles, 2) ignoring the 10-1 Russian advantage in tactical nuclear weapons, 3) dismissing the modernization asymmetry, 4) disregarding the massive Russian advantage in nuclear weapons production capability, and 5) ignoring operating practices that keep relatively more Russian warheads on alert than American.245
Russian political and military figures not only invoke the likelihood of nuclear responses to conventional attacks, they also raise the prospect of preemptive and/or preventive nuclear strikes and freely make nuclear threats against any state “rash enough” to join NATO if it is neutral like Sweden or that is willing to increase its defense effort like Denmark.246
Moscow is also developing low-yield high precision nuclear weapons and when it refers to highprecision weapons it does not specify whether they are conventional or nuclear because many systems like the Iskander missile and all fighter-bomber units are dual-capable.247 Its tactical nuclear weapons are apparently intended to be used both to compensate for conventional capabilities that may be lacking and to respond to conventional strikes.248 In other words, tactical, if not other, nuclear weapons will be used in a first-strike mode. And in exercises in Europe, Asia, and the Indian Ocean that is exactly what we have seen.249
In preparation for nuclear war scenarios Moscow also has deployed the new SARMAT heavy ICBM that possesses 10 metric tons of throw-weight and will reportedly carry to heavy and 15 medium warheads. It launch weight is about 170 tons and its destructive potential is 8 megatons and will clearly be Moscow’s main counterforce weapon.250 Similarly Moscow is also building the “Maritime Multifunctional System Status-6” a nuclear armed, high-speed 10,000 km range weapon that could operate at a depth of 1000 meters and reportedly carries a 10-megaton weapon. Its only conceivable purpose is massive countervalue slaughter.251
More recently Pentagon sources and experts like Schneider and James Howe estimated that at current rates by 2026 Russia will deploy 8,000 warheads while also modernizing deep nuclear bunkers. This total reflects certain trends beyond what we have noted above. First, at current procurement rates, Russia will reach the New START treaty limits during 2018 and is likely to break the treaty as it has broken every other arms control treaty in the last generation. This 8,000-
46

weapon arsenal includes large, low and very low-yield strategic warheads. The assessment also follows our argument by saying that Russia plans to blend conventional forces with nuclear ones in future conflicts. The smaller yield warheads will thus be deployed on new short and medium or intermediate-range missiles like the SSC-8 cruise missile and the SSN-27 Kalibr anti-ship land attack cruise missile. These new very low-yield weapons include clean weapons with little fallout, pure fusion weapons that do not require a nuclear blast to trigger them and tailored effects weapons such as neutron bombs, electromagnetic pulse blasts and x-ray and gamma ray weapons.252
Russia has systematically violated every arms control treaty except the New Start Treaty. These treaties include the INF and CFE treaties, the Vienna Note on conventional exercises and deployments, and the treaty prohibiting emplacement of nuclear weapons on the ocean floor. Indeed, according to Mark Schneider “we now have four different Russian ground-launched cruise missiles, two revealed in U.S. government sources and two reported in both the Russian and Western press, which have reported ranges that violate the INF Treaty.”253
These systematic violations of arms control treaties clearly aim to give Russia advantages vis-avis the U.S. in nuclear statecraft. But if the strategy is one of escalation dominance, it is also clear that based on its procurements Moscow is aiming to reach a state where it can threaten nuclear strikes tailored to the occasion to retain escalation dominance, intimidate potential adversaries, and be able to wage what it thinks are limited conventional or limited nuclear wars with impunity.
Space, Hypersonics, and Russian Fears of U.S. Systems
The development of space-based weapons and futuristic weapons based on “new physical principles” as well as the nuclear and conventional buildups all derive form Russian fears of Western and especially U.S. technological, economic, and military superiority. Therefore all these programs are intended to offset those forms of Western superiority. Here are areas where Moscow fears that the West has superiority and is duly striving to overcome or compensate for it. Those systems that Moscow fears most are the U.S. missile defense program in Europe and Asia, conventional program for global strikes, and Western designs on the Arctic.
Consequently weapons programs aim to deny the U.S. the utility of the missile defense network or the ability to launch global conventional strikes without suffering heavy losses. In the nonkinetic field, it has long been the case that Moscow deeply believes that the U.S. and Europe are waging information warfare against it to undermine the Putin system of governance even though there is no intention or desire by the U.S. government to do that. Moreover there is no information warfare strategy and no strategy to counter Russian IW attacks like what we saw in 2016 because President Trump has blocked any discussion of this issue. Likewise, as we have indicated above the missile defense system and the CPGS program either cannot threaten Russian nuclear missiles or in the case of the CPGS issue the program does not exist and the capabilities are not there.
While Russia is clearly developing anti-satellite and other space weapons as well as hypersonics it is not clear that it possesses an advantage over the U.S. Russia tested an anti-satellite weapon in 2016 and recently announced it is building one. 254 Indeed, the list of current Russian nuclear programs includes some hypersonic weapons systems, such as a new stealthy heavy bomber that will carry cruise missiles and reportedly hypersonic missiles. But in addition the Project 4202 vehicle that is to be delivered by the SS-19 Stiletto missile is also intended to be hypersonic.255
47

Hypersonic vehicles or alternatively boost-glide vehicles travel at speeds between Mach 5 and Mach 10 (3840/MPH to 7680MPH) use sophisticated technologies for maneuvering and boost that allow them to deliver warheads rapidly, evade defenses and target precisely. This allows for high rates of survivability against missile defense systems. These qualities excite Russian designers and planners because Moscow fully believes that the U.S. ballistic missile defense system now being built in Europe and Asia aims, despite all abundant evidence to the contrary, to neutralize Russia’s nuclear strike capability against Europe and the U.S. This explains the obsession of Russian leaders is to build supposedly invulnerable nuclear weapons like hypersonic that cannot be attacked by missile defenses.256
Development of such weapons goes a long way towards confirming that Moscow wants to hold the U.S. at risk of nuclear strikes and sees military utility in nuclear weapons as warfighting instruments. The 2015 tests of the Project 4202 weapon comprised of what Russia calls the Yu-71 hypersonic attack aircraft that supposedly could reach speeds of 7,000/MPH. It also can be used not just as a warhead for the SS-X-30 (Sarmat) but also can be adapted for the Russia’s advanced long-range strategic bomber.257 But in 2016 Moscow apparently tested the Yu-74 hypersonic attack aircraft, evidently carried by the SS-19 Stiletto ballistic missile system.
Evidently these gliders are to be loaded onto the new Sarmat or SS-X-30 state of the art ICBM that can carry up to 24 nuclear loaded Yu-74 gliders and can hit any target with a 6200-mile radius in an hour.258 Each Yu-74 glider can be equipped with a nuclear warhead and/or EW application or false target simulators to ensure penetration of any missile defense system and thus significantly raise the efficiency of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces.259 The search for missile penetration systems to break through any missile defense by means of the use of new kinds of weapons with hypermodern technologies for maneuverability also helps explain the modernization of old systems like the SS-19 Stiletto that can serve as launchers for these warheads.
But beyond deploying weapons with missile penetration capabilities, Russia is also clearly not just MIRVing its weapons it is also building medium or heavy-class weapons because the New START treaty does not impose any penalties or prohibitions for doing so unlike START-1. 260 Moreover, these plans for countering the U.S. BMD program go back at least to 2004 when that program was just announced and are clearly part of the asymmetric procurement strategy devised already at that time by Putin. They must be regarded as part of the confluence of events leading to Sergei Ivanov’s declaration that Russia was at war in 2005.261 As the late Alexander Pikayev wrote in 2008,
Russia declared that it would undertake effective “asymmetric” counter-measures in order to reduce this threat and to make the strategic situation more stable. One of these measures is to target the elements of the ABM system in Europe with Russian strategic missiles. Alongside with this, some experts and even military officials, including Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, General Yuri Baluevsky, made rather straightforward statements about the possibility that Russia would withdraw from the INF treaty as a reaction and counter-measure to the deployment of an American ABM system in Europe.262
Meanwhile allegedly the project to create hypersonic air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM) that are quite similar to the Yu-74 is also entering its final phase.263 Lastly,
48

Ostkraft analysts emphasize that the Yu-74 gliders would not only evade NATO’s missile defense systems but will be also capable of penetrating through the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) shield. The analysts argue that while the THAAD system is effective in intercepting outdated R-17 Elbrus tactical ballistic missiles, it is potentially vulnerable to the threat posed by advanced missile systems. 264
Of course, if that is really the truth and Moscow can breach THAAD then it remains a mystery why Moscow and Beijing are so upset that South Korea, which clearly faces a serious missile and nuclear threat from North Korea, opted to join the U.S. THAAD network.265 In addition if Moscow really does possess this capability then why is it so agitated about the U.S. developing and deploying THAAD in Japan and South Korea? Similarly, keeping with the idea that nuclear and futuristic weapons are regarded as much for their power to intimidate as for their actual capabilities, it is not unusual to encounter statements of this kind in the Russian media even as Moscow endlessly fulminates that it is under threat from the U.S. and its allies. Indeed, the following statement tangibly manifests the combination of overcompensation and groundless boasting to intimidate on one hand with ingrained paranoia of the Russian leadership on the other.
The Russian military are about to test the first prototypes of the S-500 Prometey air and missile defense system also known as 55R6M Triumfator M capable of destroying ICBMs, hypersonic cruise missiles, and planes at over Mach 5 speeds; and capable of detecting and simultaneously attacking up to ten ballistic missile warheads at a range of 1300KM. This means the S-500 can smash ballistic missiles before their warheads re-enter the atmosphere. So in the case of RAND-style NATO pussyfooting, the S-500 would totally eliminate all NATO air power over the Baltic States while the advanced Kornet missile would destroy all NATO armored vehicles. And that’s not even considering conventional weapon hell.
If push came to nuclear shove, the S-400 and especially the S-500 anti-missile missiles would block all incoming U.S. ICBM’s, cruise missiles, and stealth aircraft. Offensive drones would be blocked by drone defenses. The S-500 practically consigns into the dustbin stealth warplanes such as the F-22, F-35, and the B-2. The bottom line is that Russia – in terms of hypersonic missile development – is about four generations ahead of the U.S, if we measure it by the development of the S-300, S-400, and S-500 systems.
As a working hypothesis, we could describe the next system – already in the drawing boards – as the S-600. It would take the U.S. military at least ten years to develop and roll out a new weapons system, which in military terms represents a generation. Every Pentagon planner worth his pension plan should know that. Russian – and Chinese – missiles are already able to knock out the satellite guidance systems for U.S. nuclear tipped ICBMs and cruise missiles. They could also knock out the early alert warnings that the satellite constellations would give.
A Russian hypersonic ICBM flight time, launched for instance from a Russian nuclear sub all the way to the U.S. East Coast, counts for less than 20 minutes. So an early warning system is absolutely critical. Don’t count on the worthless THAAD and Patriot to do their job. Once again Russian hypersonic technology has already rendered the entire missile defense system in both the U.S. and Europe totally obsolete. So why is Moscow so worried
49

by the Pentagon placing the Aegis system so close to Russia’s borders? A credible answer is that Moscow is always concerned that the U.S. industrial-military complex might develop some really effective anti-missile missiles even though they are now about four generations behind.266
This long citation graphically combines the mendacity common to Russian propaganda with the paranoia that pervades the government and IW activity but also epitomizes the use of false information about Russian military that is disseminated precisely to intimidate or impress foreign audiences. It graphically reveals the cultural and institutional inclination to assuming that worstcase scenarios are real.
The actual state of affairs is quite different except for the paranoia. Since Moscow believes it is at war and would not hesitate to strike offensively if it could successfully do so it projects that ambition onto its presumed adversary. Moscow’s invests in hypersonics not just because the U.S. and China are doing so as well but because the capabilities that the U.S. and presumably China are now developing frighten Russia to no end. Specifically, Moscow knows it has no real defense against the U.S. CPGS program that is a purely conventional global strike capability from longranges using hypersonics and high-tech precision capabilities other than its IADS. The fact that the program has not materialized does not seem to have deterred it from investing billions to stop this threat and to proclaim that this kind of attack is likely to be the main and first strike of Western forces against Russia.267
It also fears that the BMD network now being built in Europe and Asia, including THAAD, can neutralize its first-strike nuclear capability despite laws of physics and abundant U.S. briefings to the contrary. If both these programs are used together Moscow believes Washington could decapitate its C3I by conventional means while the BMD system neutralizes any hope of a retaliatory nuclear strike.268
Statements by senior officials make Russia’s fears and apprehensions clear. Special Envoy Grigory Beredennikov, in February 2015, not only denounced the U.S. missile defense program for upending deterrence because it would supposedly give Washington the illusion it could strike Russian nuclear systems or their C3I with conventional weapons and use the BMD network to neutralize a second strike, and thereby overcome the deterrence relationship between Moscow and Washington; he went further to reiterate that for Moscow strategic stability depends on a host of non-nuclear factors as well. Specifically he stated,
We are prepared for a dialogue about further nuclear disarmament steps. At the same time, we are convinced that they are impossible without solving such problems as the unlimited growth of global U.S. missile defenses, the project of using strategic weapons with conventional warheads within the concept of “global strike” – the refusal of the United States to pledge not to deploy weapons in space, [and] the growth of qualitative and quantitative conventional imbalances.269
This is why Moscow constantly inveighs against BMD in Europe, the CPGS, and U.S. hypersonic programs, all of which, individually, or taken together, would explode strategic stability as Moscow defines it.270 As Amy Woolf of the Congressional Research Service observes,
50

Russian officials have expressed a number of concerns about U.S. conventional prompt global strike capabilities and their implications for strategic stability. They have argued that these weapons, even if armed with conventional warheads, could threaten critical targets in Russia and even threaten Russia’s strategic nuclear forces if the United States deployed large numbers of missiles armed with highly accurate reentry vehicles.
This might provide the United States with the capability to undermine Russia’s nuclear deterrent, without resorting to the first use of nuclear weapons, and might actually increase the likelihood of a U.S. attack against Russia. Moreover, even if Russia were not the target of an attack with these missiles, it might not know whether the missile carried a nuclear or conventional warhead, or whether it was headed towards a target in Russia. Finally, some Russians have argued that the United States might replace the conventional warheads with nuclear warheads to exceed the limits in a treaty.271
These Russian concerns are a major reason why beyond development of both nuclear and conventional hypersonic weapons like the projected sixth generation hypersonic fighter that will be both a hypersonic system and carry hypersonic missiles; Russia is also developing “nextgeneration” air defenses against the expected U.S. and/or NATO or Chinese hypersonics.272 But even though Moscow is developing such defenses it is clear that its main thrust is to develop offensive strike capabilities that can threaten not just Europe but the continental U.S. and manifest a desire to use nuclear weapons as warfighting weapons, not just as deterrents against conventional or nuclear attack. This procurement policy, even if it is outrunning doctrinal efforts to regulate procurements in service of a coherent strategy has its own logic, as we have shown above, namely controlling escalation processes and dynamics through all phases of any crisis.
At the same time these investments reflect the healthy respect if not actual awe that Moscow has for U.S. and Western technological and economic capabilities even as it deprecates the West as a decadent civilization. This combination of paranoia, over-compensation and cognizance of backwardness and weakness is also on display in regard to the Arctic. Here, as noted above, Russia believes that Western governments are lusting after its energy and mineral resources to seize them in order to grab Russia’s riches and dictate terms. This is the reason given behind the large-scale conventional and nuclear buildup of forces in the Arctic. While there is no such Western threat, the threat generated by these Russian capabilities is real but it can be met and rebuffed.
Apart from nuclear missiles based in the Murmansk and Kola area on board SLBMs the major threats form Russian naval and air forces in the Arctic are an invasion by Norway and the use of forces to project power into the Baltic Sea making it clear that any Baltic contingency is more than likely to become an Arctic one as well. At the same time the second arm of that latter threat is the simultaneous surge of Russian submarines, surface ships, and air forces into the North Atlantic to interdict the sea lines of communications SLOC and cut the transatlantic cables that communicate information and messages from the U.S. to the continent. This threat has recently been exposed as a major threat to NATO and steps are now underway form the reform of NATO’s command structure to the integration of air and maritime defenses on both sides of the Atlantic aswell as individual efforts by Norway in conjunction with the U.S.273
This latter threat requires a coordinated allied effort investing in anti-submarine warfare, air defense, offensive air capabilities, electronic warfare, and ISR capabilities to prevent this Russian
51

threat while missile defenses and ASW forces deal with the SLBM threat. That should the priority in the North Atlantic and the Arctic for NATO and the U.S. Of course, conflict in the Baltic and Arctic requires a much wider range and quantitative as well as qualitative investment by NATO’s members. But it is also clear that any enhancement of Western capabilities in the North Atlantic and Arctic will probably alarm Moscow considerably and lead it to divert resources to meet that threat despite the fact that it is highly doubtful anyone in NATO seeks to invade the Arctic.
Conclusion
We are confronted by a Russian adversary not only in possession of new weapons but also with new tactics and innovative thinking about contemporary warfare. Therefore we must also disenthrall ourselves and think anew about that subject. This requires more than new, advanced weapons as promised by the third offset strategy. And in any case Congressional unwillingness to spend what is needed to mount an effective defense of Europe inhibits that program and leaves without a really strategic approach to make up for the shortfall in expected or promised capabilities. That reluctance also manifests itself in Europe where too many still think that Europe is at peace and that if we could only get back to dialogues with Moscow we could refrain form the onerous challenges of self-defense.
Unfortunately, Europe is under attack whether it accepts it or not. And Putin’s Russia is an implacable foe, i.e. one that cannot be placated, for it will regard dialogue as surrender and proof of its allegations concerning the West’s lack of moral fiber. Moreover, war is inherent in Putin’s project as is empire. And if we are at war a strategic response is necessary that utilizes all the instruments of power and deploys them wisely. An essential component of the process of formulating and then implementing the required strategy is to grasp Russia’s tactics, modus operandi, operations, and strategy in Russian terms and understand the true nature of the war that has been forced upon us. Indeed, the process of disenthrallment begins with understanding that unforeseen situation and the fact we face new challenges, not just a new version of the Cold War.
Therefore business as usual, as many recommend, is not an adequate reaction to our unexpected situation. Strategy, operations, force structures, tactics, and not least operational and strategic concepts as well as intelligence must be upgraded and adapted to contemporary requirements. That also means repairing broken national security policy structure so that we can bring to bear the full weight of state capacity upon our strategic challenges. All this must be a dynamic process with constant readjustment given the dynamic nature of our time. This is a heady task for any government but we all understand that today the world has no good alternative to American leadership.”274

Abstract. Surveying available manpower resources for One Belt One Road Construction and mutual supports, this paper analyses related social and economic needs, highlights the importance of on job training and Acculturation of One Belt One Road Youths and its Guidance.
Introduction
Today, with rapid growth of Chinese economy, China can not only provide rich, colorful, high quality and inexpensive goods, but also can output more technology and equipment and maintain financial stability with other countries. The strength and development of China, has create development opportunity to Silk Road countries who need money and technology urgently.
In September 2013, President Xi Jin-ping proposed: to make the world economy more closely, mutual cooperation more in-depth, development space more broad, we can use the innovative cooperation model to build. “Silk Road Economic Zone” together, from point to area, from the line to the pieces, and gradually form a large regional cooperation. In October of the same year, President Xi Jinping said: Chinese is willing to strengthen maritime cooperation with ASEAN countries, and making good use of “Chinese ASEAN maritime cooperation fund”, develop the marine partnership to build twenty-first Century “maritime Silk Road” together. In May 2014, at the CICA summit, President Xi Jinping pointed out: China will work together with other countries, accelerate the twenty-first Century “Silk Road Economic Belt” and “Marine Silk Road” construction, start the Asian infrastructure investment bank as soon as possible, involved in the process of regional cooperation more and more deeply, accelerate the development and safety of Asia and promote each other, complement each other.
It is no doubt that, “one belt one road” is the longest span economic corridor in the world, and also the most potential economic cooperation area. It originated in the China, including Russia, Mongolia and Central Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Eastern Europe, West Asia, North Africa and other regions of the 65 countries, the total population of countries along the Silk Road accounted for 60% of the world, annual GDP accounted for 30% of the world.
For thousands of years, the expand of silk road is guide with culture, the integration of Chinese and west culture in ancient silk road has formed silk road spirit with peace, open,
141

tolerance, mutual trust, beneficial. The spirit of the Silk Road is the crystallization of multicultural integration, and is the precious wealth in the world. It is worth noting that Zhejiang, especially the Hangzhou, where has rich silk culture resources, it not only have the silk, porcelain, tea and other traditional products can represent the elements of Chinese culture ,but also have unique Liangzhu culture, Seal culture, Buddhist culture, tea culture, landscape culture, West Lake, the Grande Canale and other world cultural heritage.
According to the above mentioned，in order to build “one belt one road” economic zone, first of all, we should combine China’s surplus capacity, high technology, and program investment with Industrial development, employment development and social welfare in countries along the silk road. We also should take culture as guide, connect people along the line and Chinese common dream, living a quality life. Finally, realize the countries along the economic belt and China development together. In this magnificent business, we require a large number of people with international vision, master working language and their professional knowledge. They are also the disseminators and advocates of Chinese culture. Therefore, talent shortage has become practical demand. How to take the culture as guide and bring forth the new through the old, combine the training and spread Chinese culture, is also become a practical subject.
Methods
According to the spirit President Xi Jin-ping’s propose, building the “Silk Road Economic Belt” and “twenty-first Century Maritime Silk Road”(Hereinafter referred to as “One belt One road”), we based on the conclusion about more than 50 documents and pretest questionnaire with “One Belt One Road” foreign scholars and Overseas Chinese scholars, “One Belt One Road” foreign Affairs Officers and businessman thematic interview, we launch more than half year research around the feasibility about “One Belt One Road” talent shortage and training. The conclusion has get more than 100 related experts and scholars, more than 50 related businessman, more than 50 related foreign affairs officer’s support.
This study interviewed economic consult institution and Think tank in Far East, south East Asia (The first station of “One Belt One Road” economic construction), Europe, American and Canada (The client terminal of “One Belt One Road” economic construction). According to Xi Jinping’s speech, 《Connected and lead partners developing focus cooperation 》, Emphasis on Asian countries as the key direction, realize interconnection and interaction in Asia. Our research group and group member Jiang Bingjun (Confucius college teacher at Russian Far East University) invited Southeast Asian Transaction expert studied China provide public goods with Asian neighbors and win-win cooperation files talent shortage and training suggestion.
In view of the “One Belt One Road” began in the East Asian economic circle, ended in the developed European economic circle, throughout Europe and Africa continent, the research group and He Ying, the members of the research group invited East Asian economic circle and European Economic Circle experts studied talent support and training advice about smooth Chinese through Central Asia, Russia and Europe (Baltic); Chinese through Central Asia, West Asia to the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean; China to Southeast Asia, South Asia, India ocean; from China coastal ports over the South China Sea to India ocean, extending to Europe; from China coastal ports over the South China Sea to the South Pacific and so on.
142

The main members of our research group and relevance provinces delegation hold counsel with local economic circles (related trade and industry representatives, etc.), the relevant economic and trade cooperation think tank (Pacific Cooperation Forum, etc.), the relevant support platform (WTO, etc.) about “One belt one road” economic cooperation.
Analysis
The need of more talent master road traffic.
With the support of Asia interconnection, “One belt One road” taking every countries need into account, relying on the economic corridor, coordinating sea and land two direction, The radiation effect of road traffic is especially important because of theirs wide range and strong inclusion. From the Baltic Sea to the Pacific, from Central Asia to the transportation economic corridor of India Ocean and the Persian Gulf, east and west across the Eurasian continent, south and north connect with China and Pakistan Economic Corridor, China and India Bangladesh Economic Corridor. Urgent need for talent in the international road traffic is as follows.
The cooperate between Russia and China is based on Middle East railway, though Vladivostok - Suifenhe - Harbin - Manchuria - Chita into the old Eurasian Continental Bridge and Dalian - Harbin - Manchuria - Chita railway into the old Europe continent.
Including a new dug river with 35 km, broaden and deepen a 37 km old river, to the Suez Canal to achieve double waterway traffic in Egypt cooperation.
The cooperate between Thai and China is based on two railway, From central Ayutthaya to the north of the Chiang Rai government, and the line from central Rayong to the northeast of Nong Khai, through Laos eventually connected to the railway in China. The northeast city Nongkhai, connected the railway between Lao and China and constituting middle line of Trans-Asian Railway.
The extension of Gwadar Port, which is constructed by China and Pakistan, can reach to the north of Pakistan through Uthal, Khuzdar, Sukkur.
The Hungary-Serbia high speed railway, invested by China and constructed by China, Hungary, Serbia, is a modern railway with European standard.
The Qinghai-Tibet railway will extend 540 km from Shigatse to Gyirong before 2020. The two Ocean Railway, across the South American continent, which is invested by China and connects Brazil and Peru. China and Thai will plan to construct the Kra canal in Isthmus of Kra. The Isthmus of Kra, north to Central South Peninsula, South to Malay Peninsula, East adjacent to South China Sea, Pacific Ocean, west to Andaman Sea and India ocean. The Kunming to Bangkok International Avenue, total length more than 2600 km, is built by Western China and ASEAN, and constitute a land route aorta. The project of Jakarta to Bandung high-speed railway in Indonesia, is joint constructed and operate by China and India. The British and China government agreed to set up a high-speed rail project. China will give priority to the deployment and connection of the transportation network in Eastern Europe, West Asia and Southeast Asia. North South East West Corridor will create a new platform for international trade and investment cooperation and opening up. Southwest to the sea route will be connected to the “Silk Road Economic Zone and the twenty-first Century maritime silk road.”

Through the Yangtze River or railways, highways, and then through the Silk Road from Chongqing to Xingjiang to Europe, can access Central Asia, Russia and the whole Europe. It’s very convenience to go out. The new Eurasian Continental Bridge, from Lianyungang to Rotterdam, has constituted the new aorta of Silk Road. Kazakhstan has taken Lianyungang as their seaport.
The need of more talent master Russian and Spanish
The need of talent master Russian Far East with Broad economy, and the development is in the ascendant. Russian is widely
used in Russia and other members of the former Soviet Union. It is also the first foreign language of the Warsaw treaty member states. The use of Russian language as the mother tongue more than 140000000, as second language nearly 45000000. Under the European and American diplomatic and economic sanctions, the economic development center of Russian moved to the east naturally, and the Far East has become the new economic growth pole. Because of the Far East adjacent to Northeast China and far away from the political and economic center of Russian, Russia’s future economic development, especially the development of the Far East, urgent need Chinese support, and cannot do without the participation of Chinese Russian talents.
Eurasian Economic Union has formed and Eurasian continent develop together. On the other hand, Central Asia region, in the history and reality, is Russia’s traditional sphere. There is lot of overlap in Russia’s “Eurasian Economic Union” and “China One belt one road” construction. The development strategy of the two great countries was converged in the Eurasian continent. There is a great shortage in Russian talent at regional cooperation, human resources, trade complement, investment demand and other side which support Asia Europe Regional Integration.
The need of talent master Spanish The region using Spanish was wide and with good economic situation. Spanish was the official language of 21 countries, one of the six working languages in the United Nations, about more than 400 million native speakers, was second language in the world after Chinese. The number of Spanish speakers was about 500 million and distributed in Latin America, Spain, southern United States, Philippines and Africa, ranked fifth in the world. Spanish was closed to Italian, popular used in Europe and forty-three States of fifty states in American. Spanish have large amount of overseas Chinese, and the culture in Chinese and Spanish has integration. Local resident, in the most areas of Spanish use, was optimistic to life and harmonious trading and communicating with Chinese. Chinese culture was integrated with Spanish mainstream society, and the overseas Chinese economic strength is relatively strong, and their social status was generally higher, their industries with great potential. The silk culture at relevant region has a long history, high-end products and consumption in the Silk Road economic zone was concentrated.
The need of talent master financial and currency.
Due to the loose monetary policy and other difficulties, we need to improve the long-term mechanism of currency. In 2014, the annual growth of Japan GDP was -1.4%, and it indicates the failure of the “A double economics”, and it also show that the loose monetary policy, accelerate depreciation of the exchange rate cannot really crack the plight of the economic recession. China and many countries on Silk Road economic zone also face this problem.
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will increase the reform policy, and need
144

supervised the area allocation in currency. Joint construct the “One belt one road” have the mission of breakthrough limitations, introduce and remedy. The construction of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank relies on the “One belt one road”, and the important measures of increasing the reform policy.
So, urgent needing the talent master financial and currency, can help “One belt One road” realize three goals, one is improve the allocate efficiency of China deposit in foreign countries; secondly, it can help the countries along the silk road developing economic, and improve people’s living conditions; last, it can improving the structure of China’s foreign assets and liabilities.
The multiplicative effect of 500 billion dollars, need deal the risks of cross-border currency. The total population of the “One belt one road” were 4 billion and 400 million, accounted for sixty percent of the world; the economic aggregate is about $21 trillion, accounted for 30% of the world. In the construction of “One belt one road”, China will take infrastructure, interconnection and interaction as priority construct areas, and the infrastructure construction will bring multiplier effect of currency, every $1 investment in infrastructure construction will drive $3-$4 investment demand in other industries. In Asia, every 1 billion dollars investment in infrastructure construction will create 18000 employment opportunities. In the next 5 years, China will invest more than 500 billion dollars in the construction of “One belt One road”, and it will provide great vitality in the “One belt One road” economic zone, at the same time , it also face great challenges in returns and risks.
The need of a cooperation mechanism to coordinate currency policy.
In 1997, former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto called the eight countries in Caucasia and China as Silk Road area and start the diplomacy of silk road aim to develop Japan in Caucasia areas, this foreign policy had impact on APEC and the development and utilization of oil and natural gas resources in “One belt One road” economic zone.
In 1999, the United States Congress had passed the “Silk Road strategy act”; In 2011, U.S. State Department asked the United States in Central Asia, South Asia policy to unify the naming of the new Silk Road strategy, seeking to influence the economic development order in Central Asia and South Asia, and control abundance oil and gas resources and mineral resources.
It is no doubt that China’s currency will go aboard and go to the world. In Han and Tang Dynasties, Kai yuan Tong Bao was circulate in overseas, and after the metal currency, in October this year, RMB has become the world’s second largest trading finance currency, the fifth largest payment currency, and the sixth largest foreign trading currency. The countries along the Silk Road urgent need the value from RMB internationalization.
Suggestions
In summary, the construction of “One belt one road” economic zone is new subject in China’s economic development, its development and construction face many contradictions and difficulties in history and reality, especially in the shortage of talent in transportation, language and currency. Close to the reality demand, we have to organize and configure related training as soon as possible, accelerate the talent training in transportation, language and currency, at the same time, take the culture as guide and do well in “bring in and go out”, prepare to deal with the development of silk road.
145

To take the advantage of “Qianjiang adult college” “China Vocational Education Association” “the economic group of CNDCA Entrepreneur Association” “Legal Committee and college branch of CNDCA”, facing “One belt one road” and connecting the economic construction launch specialized training.
Hangzhou “Qianjiang adult college” was joint built by “Zhejiang confederation of trade unions” and “Zhejiang Democratic National Construction Association” in March 1979. “Qianjiang adult college”, in the National Federation of democratic parties, was rated as advanced collective at service for four modernization; meanwhile, it’s also rated as advanced collective in education and training working of National Federation of industry and Commerce, advanced collective in China democratic national construction association. This school has rich training experience in foreign language and business class and it have training qualification approved by the Ministry of education and Zhejiang government, is the excellent platform to training “going out” talent.
In 1917, the famous educationist and the initiator of China Democratic National Construction Association, Huangyanpei, had established China Vocational Education Association.
The Entrepreneur Association can provide many support in the talent shortage of “One belt One road”, especially can provide legal, accounting, finance, security and other practical support and business management, policy experience, market information and other resources support. The Legal Committee and college branch of CNDCA, in the legal support and international co-operation, can provide entrepreneur for training and the legal support from inside to outside for the group members “going out” and take part in the “One belt one road” economic construction.
To take the training of Russian talent in science and Engineering and the training of Spanish talent in cross-border trade as first, from point to area, from training shortage talent to leader Silk Road economic, making a good work and service the “One belt One road” economic zone.
According to above investigation and analyses, the road, housing, industrial and agriculture infrastructures in Siberia and the Far East need using China company’s experience, technology, equipment and talent. There is a lot of education cooperation and cultural exchanges between China and Russia, but most of them was remain on the paper, and haven’t implementation. Specific training programs, plans, professional settings require a long time to start. In 2014, Chinese students in Russia were more than 25000, and most of them prefer to choice Humanities and social science majors, such as language, sociology, education, economy, tourism, and art and so on. Due to the language and difficulty from the major, seldom have student choice major like science and Engineer which is urgent need in our country. So, whether it is from the national political direction or geographical reality demand, it is necessarily to take the training of Russian talent in science and Engineering firstly.
Spanish is the official language of 21 countries (including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Republic of Dominica, Ecuador, Salvatore, Equatorial Guinea, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Spain, Uruguay and Venezuela), one of the six working languages of the United Nations, according to the number of users in the first language ranking, about 500 million people use Spanish as their mother tongue. Spanish is also used in the United States, Belize, Philippines, Trinidad and Gibraltar, Tobago and Western Sahara.
146

With Spain, Latin American countries and China’s trade continuing to deepen, the demand of Spanish talent has appeared in the market, and it’s no doubt that Spanish talent was very “hot”. The railway from Yiwu across Xinjiang to Europe, total length more than 13 thousand km, is the longest trains in China to Europe, which rote through the new silk road economic zone, opening a Safe, efficient and convenient logistics channel for China’s small commodities exports to Europe, and it’s also an important symbol that promote the “One belt One road” interconnection and interaction strategy from conception to implementation.
To Train Traffic Talent.
The Asian infrastructure investment bank (AIIB), catch the key channels, key nodes and key projects in the infrastructure of transportation, give priority to open up the missing sections, the bottleneck of the road, support the facility of road safety protection and traffic management, improve the level of road access, drive to construct a unite transport coordination mechanism, promote the linking between passed the international customs, reloading, multiple modal transportation, gradually form a transport rule with compatible and normative, and realize facilitation in international transport, promote the construction of port infrastructure, open the sea and land road, joint built the harbor, increase sea routes and flights, enhance the information cooperate in sea logistics, expand construct the platform and mechanism in the cooperate of civil aviation, improve the level of aviation infrastructure.
The “One belt One road” had put forward full range of open and cooperative, the whole country, especially the XinJiang, where transportation system have to re layout. At first, we should change our mind, turning the filed in the edge into front edge, integrate passageway in the seaport and center city, as a core area, XinJiang should interconnection and interaction. Second, XinJiang should take the task of opening up actively. Third, to become core area, the supporting facilities have to equipped and improved, especially in the soft power and comprehensive construction.
In the age of big data, the support of information was very important. HeLunZhi, the director of economic research Institute in Xinjiang University, had put forward to build Central Asia database. To promote the development of “One belt one road”, we should build the Central Asia database at first. Supporting the decision-making information for the national major development strategy. The construction of core area and the economic development in Xinjiang, needing a large amount of information from the countries around us, so that, we can provide decision-making suggestions when our country and government are making planning, at last, it can become think tank for countries decision.
The expert in the two university had suggest that, in the future, Xinjiang University and Tongji University will continue to deepen cooperation, holding the seminars irregularly scheduled, using both advantage resources, finding the research breakthrough point together, providing the research program and supporting theory for the country and Xinjiang implement the “One belt One road” strategy. Mengnan, the director of Central Asia Research Institute in Xinjiang University show that, two university, in their subject, all have advantages, in the construction, transportation and international liaison, etc., the Tongji University was very prominent, Xinjiang University have advantage in researching Xinjiang, the neighboring countries, the political situation in Central Asia, the situation, the economy, the national culture, religion, law, environment and so on. Both side of school though communication, can put forward suggestions for country and municipality about the economic construction of “One belt One road”, which as a reference for decision making by the government, and promote the development of Xinjiang as the Silk Road Economic Zone core area.
147

To Train Talent Master Currency.
Financially speaking, China, as the important trading partners for the countries along the “One belt One road”, will invest in these countries, furthermore, driving the output of goods and services, expanding the RMB export as capital, making the RMB in the global allocation of resources, production and sales, and other processes, to be further used, Promoting the regional and internationalization of RMB.
China’s currency out of the country, to the world is not unique to the modern era. During the Han and Tang dynasty, Kaiyuantongbao had begun circulate abroad. And after the metal currency age, RMB, the modern credit currency, which development process is remarkable. To October this year, RMB has become the world’s second largest trading finance currency, the fifth largest payment currency, and the sixth largest foreign currency trading currency. The RMB going out is not zero-sum game, it can bring values for the countries along the “One belt one road” economic zone. At the same time, the internationalization of RMB will also bring a lot of new opportunities for China, further, driving the implementation and realization of “One belt one road”.
To Create a Good Brand of Hangzhou and Spreading the Chinese Culture
Baozhicheng, the director of Zhejiang institute of culture and arts, suggest that today ,we are going to see the history, and we can’t see it in plane but we should see relationship between silk road and Hangzhou from a three-dimensional perspective.
In the history, however, the starting point of Land Silk Road was Changan, the starting point of Maritime Silk Road was Quanzhou, but the starting point is relatively speaking, different historical periods have different center of gravity.
From the Northern Song Dynasty to the Yuan Dynasty, Hangzhou had always been one of the biggest port cities in the southeast coast, not only set Shibosi which was the foreign trade management organization, but also became the central transshipment port for foreign goods and tribute. From historical data and literature point of view, in the period of Southern Song Dynasty the earliest foreign trade warehouse was in Linan (Hangzhou).
In Yuan Dynasty, between the Hangzhou and the world’s largest port “Quanzhou” at that time, had built a sea station, which used to transport the foreign goods and tribute to Dadu (Beijing).
The four western travelers of middle age, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuba, Hubei Duolikedou, had visited Hangzhou, so Hangzhou has a very important historical position in the foreign trade of the maritime Silk Road.
Hangzhou can bring forth the new through the old, and promote the hard and soft power in comprehensive construction of “One belt One road” economic zone through the new model of do pioneering work and innovation and spread Chinese culture.

Russia in the Middle East —

Abstract
It may be a cliché, but that does not make it any less true: Russia has returned to the Middle East. Since intervening militarily in Syria in 2015, Russia has transformed the battlefield, saved its allies, and established itself as the driving force in international diplomacy on Syria. Meanwhile, Moscow is selling arms worth billions of dollars to Algeria and Egypt, and has teamed up with Saudi Arabia to put its thumb on the scale of global oil prices. Russia is working closely with Iran, Turkey, and Israel in Syria, and maintains relations with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and a host of other nations – many of which are hostile to each other but friendly to Russia. Looking back at Russia’s rise to influence in the Middle East since the 2011 Arab Spring, it seems clear that President Vladimir Putin’s successes stem less from a consistently applied strategy than from the effective, pragmatic exploitation of new opportunities and unforced Western errors. Nonetheless, there are limits to how far Russia can rise, and Putin will need to watch his step as he moves deeper into a region riddled with complex, interlocking conflicts. Even today, Moscow’s regional footprint remains small next to that of the United States and, mired in economic and structural dysfunction at home, it is far from certain that the Kremlin’s swelling global ambition can be sustained in the longer term. As Russia’s appetite for influence increases, so do the risks. This UI Paper traces Moscow’s role in the Middle East and North Africa through Soviet times to the present day. It seeks to shed light on what drives the Kremlin’s engagement with the region, how local actors respond to Russian policy, and the role Russia is carving out for itself in the Middle East.1

The Soviet Union and the Middle East
Russia is no newcomer to the Middle East. For centuries, Imperial Russia traded and fought with Persia and the Ottoman Empire, while the Arab World “lay just outside the limit of St. Petersburg’s geopolitical ambitions.”2
The Soviet Union would eventually reverse that order, albeit more out of necessity than choice. Bursting into the region like a bull in a china shop after the Second World War, it took Soviet dictator Josef Stalin only a few years to alienate every regional power of significance. In the late 1940s, a short-lived Soviet flirtation with Kurdish and Azeri separatism tipped Iran into the pro-Western camp;3 military saber-rattling set neutral Turkey on the path to NATO membership;4 and support for Israeli independence repelled the rising regional force of Arab Nationalism.5 Stalin then turned against Israel, too.6
Although these were mostly self-inflicted wounds, they were nonetheless extremely

harmful to Moscow’s strategic position. The three nations regarded in Moscow as the Middle East’s northern tier – Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan – were consistently prioritized in Soviet geopolitical thinking over the mostly Arab nations further south.7 As a result of Stalin’s policy blunders, however, Moscow would remain at a crippling disadvantage in Turkey and Iran for the duration of the Cold War.
The growth of Soviet influence across the Arab World in the 1950s and 1960s provided some recompense. Communist doctrine remained unpopular for its atheism, but the Soviet Union’s outspoken support for Third World liberation struggles struck a chord with Arab nationalists.8 Anti-colonialism mingled with dreams of social equality, and Arab politics already bristled against the West over a host of grievances: Israel’s 1947–1949 expulsion of the Palestinians, the 1954–1962 Algerian War, the 1955 Baghdad Pact, and the 1956 Suez Crisis, to name just a few.
By loosening the shackles of ideology, offering assistance to new and struggling nations, and latching on to popular nationalist causes such as the Palestinian struggle, Stalin’s successor, Nikita Khrushchev, was able to leapfrog the Turkish-Iranian wall and establish new bases
aborted only by Stalin’s death. Primakov traces the anti-Jewish campaign to a cynical ploy by feuding party chiefs. See Yevgeny Primakov, Russia and the Arabs: Behind the Scenes in the Middle East from the Cold War to the Present, Basic Books, 2009, p. 254–259. 7
Afghanistan had served as an arena for great power conflict already in the 19th century, during the Russian-British “great game.” The significance accorded to Iran and Turkey is not difficult to understand. Both are regional powers with considerable cultural influence, whose imperial pasts are closely intertwined with Russia’s own. Their combined population is larger than that of modern Russia and each is strategically located in its own way, dominating the opposite shores of the Black Sea and the Caspian. Iran has large hydrocarbon resources and overlooks the world’s most oil-rich region, the Persian Gulf, and the oil trade chokepoint at the Hormuz Straits. Turkey’s Bosporus Straits control access to the Black Sea, which, to quote the British specialist on Soviet strategy Michael MccGwire, becomes in times of war a “grenade in Russia’s gut.” Michael MccGwire, “The Middle East and Soviet Military Strategy,” Middle East Report No. 151, March–April 1988. 8

of support in the Arab parts of the Middle East.9
The centerpiece of the Soviet Union’s new regional position was Egypt, where a military ruler, Gamal Abdel-Nasser, had seized power from the British-backed King Farouq. Although he started out closer to the United States, Abdel-Nasser was soon disenchanted with America’s reluctance to sell him modern weaponry for the conflict with Israel. A pioneering, Moscowfacilitated weapons deal with Czechoslovakia in 1955 broke the West’s monopoly on arms sales to the Arab states and drew Abdel-Nasser into the Soviet orbit. By the end of the 1950s, Egypt had emerged as the Third World’s largest recipient of Soviet military aid and a jumping-off point for continued Soviet penetration of the region.10
Although Egypt remained Moscow’s primary client, the Soviet Union soon established friendly ties with other republican-leftist regimes in Algeria, Libya, South Yemen, Syria, and Iraq, in addition to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).
However, even if these nations cooperated with Moscow and ordered copious amounts of Soviet arms, the Kremlin’s control over their behavior was very limited. Only South
9 At the ideological level, Khrushchev oversaw a pragmatic
softening of Party doctrine in the 1950s and 1960s, which made it known that Moscow wanted friendly ties with non-Communist groups and nations, as long as they showed signs of a “socialist orientation.” Such status would soon be bestowed as “a matter of political expediency,” almost like diplomatic recognition.

As the senior Party official and Middle East specialist, Karen Brutents, recalled in 1998: “Despite the very close – closer than with any other Arab state – relations with South Yemen, where there were about 500 Soviet military advisers and at different times from 1.5 to 4 thousand civilians, we were not able to seriously affect the course of events in this small country.” Cited in Vasiliev 2018, p. 162. 12
Apart from South Yemen, no Soviet-allied Arab state allowed Moscow-backed Communist parties much room for maneuver.

Yemen was fully Soviet-aligned and under the control of a Marxist-Leninist party, and even there the Kremlin struggled to master local politics.11 As a rule, the Soviet Union’s regional partners were stubborn, prickly nationalists and inveterate authoritarians who would not share power either domestically or with foreign allies.12 Like their US rivals, Soviet leaders repeatedly found “the tail wagging the dog,” in that they were dragged against their will into unwanted disputes by Middle East allies that were “confident that circumstances would compel Moscow to go along.”13
Apart from the leftist and nationalist republics, most of the rest of the Middle East remained solidly attached to the USled Western camp, particularly the conservative kingdoms of the Persian Gulf. Most of the Gulf monarchies did not even have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, Kuwait being a prominent exception.
Moscow had also severed diplomatic relations with Israel after the Six-day War of 1967, in which Jewish forces overran Sovietbacked Arab armies, and the Kremlin regularly castigated Israel as an outpost of US imperialism.14 Nonetheless, while Soviet anti-Zionism was harsh and “laced with doses of anti-Semitism,” Moscow’s leaders stuck to the idea of some type of territorial or political compromise, instead of
For example, Abdel-Nasser continued to crack down on Communists intermittently in the 1950s and 1960s, even at the height of his relationship with the Soviet Union. In 1965 the Egyptian Communist Party was forced to dissolve in return for a subservient role within Abdel-Nasser’s own Arab Socialist Union. In Iraq, the Baath Party massacred members of the Iraqi Communist Party when it briefly ruled the country in 1963. When the Baathists returned to power in 1968, they sought to co-opt Communists, largely to please the Soviet Union. However, around the time of Saddam Hussein’s takeover in the late 1970s, the party was again persecuted and driven underground, where it joined the opposition and condemned the Iraqi government as “fascist.” Nonetheless, Iraqi-Soviet ties continued to develop, and Soviet officials reluctantly turned a blind eye to the plight of their Iraqi comrades. For a useful survey of how Soviet-backed Communist parties fared in various Middle Eastern nations, see Vasiliev 2018, pp. 130–159. 13

endorsing the call by Arab radicals for Israel’s destruction.15
To all involved, the Israeli-Arab conflict was the region’s central political issue, arousing interest across the world and raw passion in the Middle East. Each superpower regarded it as an arena in which it had to prove its worth, even as both “shared a healthy fear of the Arab-Israeli conflict taking on global proportions.”16 The closest call came during the October 1973 war, when the Soviet Union threatened to intervene unless Israel was stopped from once again routing the Egyptian Army, to which the White House responded by raising its nuclear alert level. This had a “sobering effect” and both sides quickly backed down to enforce a ceasefire.17
By then, Egypt had begun to slide out of the Kremlin’s embrace, looking for a better deal from the United States. Moscow watched with mounting dismay as President Anwar al-Sadat, who had taken power on the death of Abdel-Nasser in 1970, expelled Soviet advisers, closed Soviet naval bases, and finally signed the 1978 Camp David Accords, which pulled Egypt out of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Sadat’s defection was a blow from which Moscow’s regional influence would never recover, and it has lingered in Soviet and Russian policymaking as a memento of the danger of over-committing to fickle local leaders. With Egypt gone, Moscow was forced to lean more heavily on Syria to remain relevant in Arab-Israeli affairs, but Soviet strategy was now entirely defensive

and reactive, and Syria’s Hafez al-Assad proved a difficult, Machiavellian partner.
The 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, a key US ally, briefly seemed as if it might turn the tables back in Moscow’s favor. The Politburo did its best to court the new Shia Islamist regime, including by stopping arms deliveries to Saddam Hussein’s Iraq when he attacked Iran in 1980 and launched a war that would last until 1988.18 However, Ayatollah Khomeini’s anti-Communism turned out to be almost as fierce as his antiAmericanism, and Tehran remained coldly suspicious of the Soviet Union.
Another seemingly positive development for the Soviet Union was the 1978 Saur Revolution in Afghanistan, which brought Marxists to power in this impoverished but strategically important neighbor. However, the Communist takeover had not in fact been engineered by the Soviet Union and served only to destabilize an already pliable neighbor.19 Success soon turned to disaster as rival Afghan Communist factions fought among themselves while terrorizing the population to such an extent that the countryside exploded in rebellion. Soviet leaders began to fret about the possibility that Kabul might flip, Egypt-style, to the US side, or that the regime could fall to hostile fundamentalists, as in Iran.20
In late 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan to replace the leadership in Kabul with a more pliable faction.21 The invasion sparked worldwide protest and tarnished Moscow’s image in the Islamic world. From the Kremlin’s point of view, the invasion had been a defensive move, well

within its own sphere of influence but, however argued, it was a terrible mistake. US, Saudi Arabian, and Pakistani support quickly powered up the Islamist guerrillas, trapping the Soviet Union in an unwinnable ten-year war that drained resources, alienated allies, demoralized the Soviet citizenry, and killed more than one million Afghans.22

No less significantly for the Middle East, the anti-Soviet struggle also drew Arab volunteer fighters to the Afghan side, giving rise to the militant fundamentalist ideology now known as Salafi-jihadism. When the Soviet Union began to withdraw in 1988, one group of such fighters led by Osama bin Laden created al-Qaeda to continue the war outside Afghanistan.23

By the time Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the Soviet Union was backsliding economically and politically. It was stuck in a hopeless war in Afghanistan and “had no trustworthy ally in the Middle East.”24 Even Iraq had begun to drift away from the Soviet side, seeking US and Gulf Arab aid against Iran, and all of Moscow’s Arab partners were failing to pay the debts they had amassed over years of arms supplies. Making matters worse for the hydrocarbon-dependent Soviet economy,

oil prices plummeted in 1985, partly due to Saudi Arabia’s overproduction.
While enacting liberalizing reforms at home, Gorbachev also tried to put Soviet foreign policy on a more sustainable footing by pulling out of Afghanistan and seeking coexistence and cooperation with the West. His doctrine of “New Thinking” thawed relations with Israel and the Gulf monarchies, but spelled bad news for the Soviet Union’s traditional Arab partners.25

Oil-dependent Algeria fell into disarray in 1988. After its first free elections were aborted by a 1992 military coup, there followed a devastating civil war. Communist South Yemen withered amid byzantine infighting and economic decay, and was ultimately swallowed up by North Yemen in a 1990 merger. Libya and Syria sputtered on in dysfunctional stagnation, but the antiWestern bomb plots of Libya’s leader, Moammar al-Gaddafi, drew Washington’s wrath and finally led the Soviet Union to tire of him. In 1986, Gorbachev declared that he would no longer be funding Syria’s rubleburning arms race with Israel, which cooled relations with Syria and made Assad look for ways to mend fences with the United States.
Saddam Hussein’s August 1990 invasion of Kuwait provided a dramatic endpoint to the Soviet era in the Middle East. Moscow first joined the chorus of condemnation and voted for an intervention at the UN, but Soviet policy then bogged down in “confused, shifting, contentious and contradictory” messages as Gorbachev’s New Thinking ran up against opposite reflexes among Communist Party hardliners.26 As the Soviet Union stood aside, the United States took charge of a coalition that easily ousted the Iraqi Army from Kuwait, setting the stage for a new era.
The Soviet Union reached its long-overdue end with a whimper in December 1991. Left alone and ringed by 14 newly independent nations, a truncated and disoriented Russia

Tension over the Kuwait War was one of the reasons behind Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze’s December 1990 resignation, and did much to sour the mood inside the Soviet regime. The hardliners’ criticism focused on the loss of prestige involved in abandoning a “strategic ally” (per the Soviet-Iraqi 1972 Treaty of Friendship of Cooperation), as well on the economic losses that would inevitably follow.

would now be forced to find its own role on the world stage.27
Post-Soviet Russian Middle East Policy
As independent Russia looked to the Middle East, it was now free of the ideological shackles that had limited Soviet policy in so many ways, but Russia was also far weaker than the Soviet Union and preoccupied with problems at home and in the near abroad. The end of the war in Afghanistan and then of the Soviet Union did not mean that Moscow could stop worrying about the Caucasus and Central Asia region. Former Soviet territory had crumbled into a messy cluster of smaller Sunni Muslim nations, several of them prone to separatist, religious, or ethnic unrest that, to Russian leaders, looked like an invitation to foreign interference via Turkey or Iran. Islamist radicalism was already seeping into the region from the Arab World and Afghanistan, raising fears that it would serve as a conveyor belt for Middle East problems into Russia itself, the population of which is 10–15 percent Sunni Muslim.
The early independence years under Boris Yeltsin, who served as Russia’s president from 1991 to 1999, saw little activity in the Middle East. The Foreign Ministry continued to build on Gorbachev’s legacy by repairing relations with the Gulf Arab monarchies, with an eye to new trade opportunities in
major economic interests in Iraq and some estimates put potential Soviet losses from the conflict at $18 billion. However, Gorbachev’s stance also won the Soviet Union some Gulf Arab economic aid and credits. Nizameddin 1999, pp. 61–65, 189– 190. 27
As Russian Middle East expert Dmitri Trenin has put it, “The Soviet Union was about an idea. Russia’s idea is about Russia itself.” Quoted in Michael Young, “The View from Moscow,” Carnegie Middle East Center, January 14, 2019, carnegiemec.org/diwan/78114?lang=en.

particular. However, the Middle East still stood for less than 1 percent of Russia’s annual trade in the mid-1990s.28 Moscow also began to build a new and close relationship with Israel, aided by the fact that Soviet Jewish emigration had created a large Russian-speaking population in Israel.
“In the past our country relied on just a handful of states in the region – Iran, Iraq, Libya, etc. But that was an extremely unfortunate choice,” Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said when touring the Gulf monarchies in 1992. “Now we prefer to deal with stable, moderate regimes.”29
Contacts with former Cold War partners such as Syria and Algeria dropped off precipitously. They had little to offer except to repay their enormous Soviet-era military debts and, no matter how much Moscow complained, they did not. However, Russia chose to maintain a little-used naval depot in the Syrian port city of Tartous, which, after bases in Vietnam and Cuba closed in 2002, would become its last remaining military facility outside former Soviet territory.
The Chechen Trauma
In 1994–1996 and again from 1999, Moscow waged an exceedingly violent war against separatist fighters in Chechnya, a Sunni Muslim region in the Caucasus. Recalling the specter of Afghanistan, the Chechen conflict was distasteful and demoralizing even to Russians who supported the crackdown, and it created serious friction

with Sunni Muslim nations abroad. It did not help that Russia also backed Serb forces against Sunni Muslims in BosniaHerzegovina (1992–1995) and Kosovo (1998–1999).
Although the Chechen rebellion had begun as a nationalist affair, fighters were mobilized using religious slogans and the uprising quickly radicalized amid civilian trauma and displacement. A contributory factor was the involvement of Salafi fundraisers and clerics in the Gulf who sent money, religious literature, and even a small number of Arab volunteer fighters into the Caucasus, many of them veterans of the Afghan war.30
The Chechen conflict thus drew Russia’s attention once more to the risk of religious extremism and instability along its southern border, where Caucasian and Central Asian nations were exposed to political and religious influences from the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey. Chechen violence also inspired a harsh Islamophobic backlash in Russia, undermining cohesion in wider society.
Throughout the late 1990s, Russia accused Saudi Arabia of supporting the Chechen insurgency or, which was perhaps more likely, turning a blind eye to those who did. Riyadh denied Russia’s accusations, but the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States changed the situation. Now Washington also brought pressure to bear on Saudi Arabia to shut down jihadi-linked charities, including those involved with Chechnya. As the fighting in Chechnya died

Zawahiri apparently managed to keep his identity secret and ended up being charged with nothing more serious than illegally crossing the Russian border. On his release, he left for Afghanistan to join Osama bin Laden.

down in the early 2000s, the Russia-Saudi Arabia relationship recovered.
Afghanistan was another major concern throughout the 1990s, radiating instability and extremism into post-Soviet Central Asia and southern Russia. The Taliban movement, which seized Kabul in 1996, had quickly linked up with the Chechen rebels and also began to host Uzbek and other Central Asian extremists. Moscow tried to weaken the Taliban by funneling weapons to the coalition of warlords known as the Northern Alliance, but had no stomach for deeper involvement in Afghan politics.
Ironically, the Shia theocracy in Iran would turn out to be Russia’s most useful partner in containing Islamist militancy. Iran had by and large ignored the Chechen issue, partly because it was uneasy over the rebels’ Saudi and Sunni-Salafi links – Iran is Shia and hostile to Saudi Arabia – but mostly to avoid provoking the Russians. According to Rouzbeh Parsi, head of the Middle East Program at the Swedish Institute for International Affairs, “It doesn’t matter how Muslim the Chechens are – Iran would still never lift a finger to help them, because the relationship with Russia trumps that.” He characterizes the Russia-Iran relationship as “highly pragmatic on both sides.”31 Tehran also shared Moscow’s hostility to the Taliban for reasons of its own, and worked effectively with Russia to shut down a 1992– 1997 civil war in Tajikistan.

Moscow and Ankara were more clearly at odds over Chechnya, although neither side wanted to let their differences slide out of control. In early 1994, Russia delivered a subtle warning to Turkey that any interference in Chechnya would be countered by support for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a former Soviet client still battling the Turkish government. Taking the hint, Ankara agreed in a series of secret talks to curb support for the Chechens, even as it continued to assail Russia’s conduct in public.32 Moscow returned the favor when PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan was expelled from Syria in 1998 by denying him asylum. He was later captured in Kenya and brought to Turkey, where he remains in jail.33
The Chechen rebellion petered out in the early 2000s. Russia won the war by applying overwhelming force and splitting the separatist movement. Hardline remnants of the insurgency continued to melt into the international jihadi landscape and committed a long string of gruesome suicide attacks on Russian civilians.34 Meanwhile, the pro-Russian local government wound up in the hands of Ramzan Kadyrov, an ex-rebel backed by the Kremlin. Kadyrov’s clannish and religiously conservative state-within-a-state has embarrassed Moscow by kidnapping and shooting dissidents and engaging in all manner of organized crime.35 However, Chechnya is not a hornets’ nest the Kremlin is eager to kick again, and so Kadyrov has been left to his own devices.

The wars in Chechnya are now slowly fading into history, but their unsavory and unsatisfying legacy is very much present. The situation in the Caucasus continues to serve as a potent reminder to Russian policymakers of the role that Islamism and chaos in the Middle East can play in unsettling Russia’s “soft underbelly.”
Reasserting Russian Particularity
By the mid-1990s, the Western-friendly foreign policies represented by Kozyrev were being edged aside by resurgent nationalism and superpower nostalgia. Russia’s turn back to a more hard-nosed and independent foreign policy was symbolized by the rise of Yevgeny Primakov, a wellknown Arabist and former Pravda Middle East correspondent who assumed office first as foreign intelligence chief (1991– 1996), then as foreign minister (1996–1998), and finally as prime minister (1998–1999).
Primakov had no desire to return to the “bogus ideological concerns” of Soviet days, but he envisioned a Russia that stood clearly apart from the West, although not necessarily in constant opposition to it.36 He repeatedly challenged the United States and Europe, including over Kosovo, which drew applause from a public frustrated by Russia’s post-Soviet international impotence.
In the Middle East, Primakov worked to rebuild relations with Iraq, lobbying for softer UN sanctions and condemning US air raids in 1996 and 1998. He also sought out

other actors shunned by the West. Under Primakov, the Foreign Ministry would meet with both Israel and Hezbollah, brushing aside Israeli and US objections to what they regarded as a terrorist group.37 The protests were perhaps part of the attraction – Primakov’s Russia wanted to carve out a niche for itself that was specifically not in the Western mold.
Nonetheless, Primakov had a weak hand to play in the region closest to his heart. He tried in vain to raise Russia’s profile by engaging with the Israel-PLO and IsraelSyria peace talks, but was rejected: “We only need one intermediary and that should be the United States,” snapped Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Primakov found such attitudes “quite unacceptable” but could do very little about it.38 Louder language and sharper elbows could not conceal the fact that Russia remained a weak and crisis-ridden nation, which defaulted on its debts in 1998.39
Primakov had hoped to succeed the ailing Yeltsin but was blindsided by Vladimir Putin’s sudden ascent from the depths of the intelligence apparatus.40 Putin was appointed acting president on December 31, 1999, and he was formally elected in March 2000. Originally perceived as the more West-friendly figure of the two, Putin continued to build on parts of Primakov’s popular, nationalist legacy. In particular, he adopted Primakov’s overarching vision of a “multipolar” world, in which Russia should coexist with the United States as a major power among others.

Middle East Engagement under Putin
According to Talal Nizameddin, a scholar of Russian-Arab relations, Moscow’s Middle East policy in the late 1990s aimed “to ensure stability, to minimalise US influence, and to allow fair access to trade and general economic relations.”41 In this calculus, some countries loomed larger than others: Turkey, Iran, and Iraq were deemed most worthy of Russia’s attention, while Syria, Israel, and Saudi Arabia formed a second tier.42
The Arab World remained largely unaffected by the wave of political liberalization that had swept the world after the fall of the Soviet Union. With the exception of South Yemen, which had ceased to exist, and Algeria, which had ended its one-party state and was just emerging from civil war, little seemed to have changed since the final years of the Cold War. Moammar al-Gaddafi continued to rule Libya, Saddam Hussein governed Iraq, and Hafez al-Assad’s son, Bashar, had inherited power in Syria. The IsraeliPalestinian conflict remained the Arab World’s central preoccupation, and Yasser Arafat still controlled the PLO.
However, the regional balance was no longer the same. The Arab World’s center of gravity had shifted decisively toward the Gulf, and oil-wealthy conservative kingdoms such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar were now top names in Arab politics. By 2002, the victory of Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s reformistIslamist AK Party in Turkish elections would

add another element to the mix by making Turkey a player in Arab politics.
On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda attacked the United States, which reacted by launching a “war on terror” that has yet to end. In crisis, Putin saw opportunity: he offered himself up to US President George W. Bush as a counterterrorism partner, highlighting Russia’s history with Chechen jihadis. Soon after the attacks, Russia also facilitated the US invasion of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, even though it brought American troops uncomfortably close to Russia’s own borders.
However, problems began to pile up soon after. Russian leaders were angered by new US missile defense plans (officially aimed at Iran) and NATO expansion into Eastern Europe. They were irritated by US criticism of the Kremlin’s democratic record and of its abuses in Chechnya, and troubled by US influence creeping deeper into Central Asia after the fall of the Taliban.
The US rush to war in Iraq in 2002–2003 put a deeper crack in the US-Russian relationship.43 Russia opposed the war, anticipating correctly that it stood to lose a major arms client and oil industry partner, and that Saddam Hussein’s fall would whip up regional instability. Most of all, Putin refused to accept that the United States could unilaterally depose undesirable governments. For the first time since the mid-1980s, Moscow took a hard stance against Washington over a Middle East problem. Russian diplomats linked up with France in the UN Security Council to deny Bush the UN resolution he had sought, and Primakov was dispatched to Baghdad on a quixotic peacemaking mission.44

Nothing worked: the United States and its “coalition of the willing” invaded as planned in March 2003. Instead of demonstrating Russia’s determination, the invasion of Iraq highlighted its irrelevance, humiliating Putin and poisoning US-Russian relations. American talk about a campaign to democratize the Middle East, with voices on the US right advocating invasions of Syria and Iran next, struck a raw nerve in Russia, where policymakers and nationalist media were already fretting over the phenomenon of “color revolutions.”
The term refers, in Russian politics, to a string of civil uprisings across the former Eastern Bloc, most notably in Serbia (2000), Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004), and Kyrgyzstan (2005). The protests targeted Russia-friendly autocrats, were Westernendorsed and, to a much lesser extent, Western-supported. Since the early 2000s, growing numbers of Russians, including policymakers, have embraced the idea that the United States is trying to topple Russian allies by both military (Iraq) and “hybrid” (color revolutions) means; and that unless Russia acts decisively the tumbling dominoes may reach the Kremlin itself.
Ironically, events in Iraq also made another, even greater, contribution to the radicalization of Russian foreign policy: they helped trigger the 2003–2008 surge in oil prices that lifted Russia out of its postSoviet economic malaise and gave Putin the muscle to match his growing ambition.
Talk to All, Trade with All
The Iraq war transformed Arab politics. Rising oil prices and the installation of a Shia-dominated government in Baghdad empowered Iran, which in turn triggered deep fears among the Saudi-led Gulf Arab

kingdoms. Saudi-Iranian rivalry dovetailed with the Sunni-Shia conflict that had erupted across occupied Iraq, and this lethal combination sent ripples of religious sectarianism across the region.
Russia had little interest in Sunni-Shia infighting but was considerably more keen to share in the oil bonanza. Yeltsin had never bothered to visit the Middle East and neither had Putin in the first four years of his presidency, but that changed. In December 2004, the Russian president made a first state visit to Turkey, quickly followed by Egypt, Israel, and Palestine in 2005. In 2006–2008, he toured Algeria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Turkey (again), the United Arab Emirates, Iran, and Libya. These were nations in which Russia had commercial and political interests. A former Soviet ally such as Syria, which offered neither, did not make the president’s itinerary.
Nonetheless, the Russian president moved to re-energize ties with Moscow’s traditional partners as part of a broader strategy to cut loose from the Soviet Union’s tangled economic legacy.45 After a decade and a half of fruitless haggling over multi-billion debts owed by Algeria, Syria, Iraq, and Libya, Russia simply wrote them off to clear the way for new contracts, especially arms exports – this time on strictly commercial terms.

Politics were not entirely neglected. Russian diplomats continued to show up to Middle East peace conferences, even though they had little influence.
In 2002, the Foreign Ministry began a campaign of Muslim outreach and sought entry to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Putin argued that Russian Muslims “have a right to feel part of the Muslim world,” apparently in an attempt to repair some of the damage done by the Chechen war.50 Observer membership was granted in 2005.51
Efforts were also made to promote Russia’s own politics. The state-run Arabic-language propaganda station Rusiya al-Yawm, based on the Russia Today template, began television broadcasts by satellite in 2007. However, although Moscow was eager to air its opinions, it mostly tried to remain aloof from regional disputes. In part, this was a consequence of Russia’s lingering weakness – a lesson taken to heart after the Iraq war – but it also reflected a determination not to get trapped in divisive,

Soviet-style partisanship. Moscow’s new game plan was to actively but prudently build ties across all ideological divides, focusing on economic gain and shunning investments that did not make sense on their own terms.52 As Putin later put it, in his trademark, off-color way:
Back in Soviet times, you’ll recall the developments in Egypt, where we invested unilaterally for political and ideological reasons. And then – bang – the situation changed, and where did all our investments end up? It would not be proper to say it to this audience, but you understand what I mean.53
Events in Syria and Lebanon in 2004–2006 demonstrated the limits of Russia’s commitment to old allies, and the priority often accorded to more important Western or regional partners.
Russia had drawn closer to Bashar alAssad’s government in Syria after the Iraq war, irritated by US threats against

Damascus and eager to push back against regime change narratives.54 However, when Saudi Arabia, the United States, and France teamed up to pressure Assad to pull his army out of Lebanon, where it had loitered since 1976, Moscow urged Assad to comply. Even after street protests brought Lebanon’s pro-Syrian cabinet down and forced Assad’s army out in the spring of 2005, Moscow resisted the temptation to fall back on its color revolution narrative. Instead, Russian diplomats seemed to accept that the Syrians had blundered and would have to pay the price.55 When Israel then invaded Lebanon in response to a Hezbollah attack in the summer of 2006, Moscow adopted a nuanced approach that apportioned blame on both sides, even though it grew more critical of Israel’s refusal to accept a ceasefire as the war went on.56
The Iranian nuclear crisis offered another look at Russia’s balancing of different interests. Iran had come under Western pressure, underpinned by threats of an Israeli or perhaps even a US attack, after secret elements of its nuclear research program were revealed in 2002–2003. Suspicions that Iran was building a nuclear bomb were serious enough, but they gained added importance due to Iran’s increasingly influential role in Iraqi, Lebanese, and Palestinian politics.

55 The protests had been triggered by the February 2005
murder of former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri, a Saudi-French ally and leader of Lebanon’s Sunni community. Hariri’s death was widely blamed on Assad and his Lebanese allies (in 2011 an international tribunal formed by the UN indicted members of Hezbollah for the murder) and became a rallying point for an otherwise disparate coalition of nations and groups that wanted Syrian forces out of Lebanon. Russia refused to blame Damascus and rejected talk of UN sanctions, but made no meaningful effort to help Assad defeat Saudi, US and French pressure. I am grateful to Hanna Notte for insights on Russia’s attitude to the Hariri affair and the Syrian presence in Lebanon. 56

Moscow took an active role in the P5+1 Group established in 2006 by the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany. The role of the P5+1 was to develop the right mix of UN sanctions and negotiations to get Iran to commit to a monitored, nonmilitary nuclear program. Part of the appeal of the P5+1 construct was that it satisfied the Kremlin’s craving for recognition as a major power, but Russia had many other reasons to get involved. It disliked the idea of an Iranian bomb, both in and of itself and because it might trigger copycat efforts across the Middle East.57 Moscow was equally concerned, or perhaps more concerned, by the risk of a breakdown in negotiations. In the absence of a peaceful resolution, US or Israeli attacks might spark massive instability in Russia’s backyard. Last but not least, Russia wanted leverage over Iran, a highly prioritized goal going back to Soviet days and before. Despite some tension with hardline US and European actors, Russia therefore stayed engaged with the P5+1, trying to pitch creative solutions and often appearing as Iran’s best friend in the group.58

Beyond the Middle East, however, the Kremlin’s attitude to the West was taking a more confrontational turn. In a much remarked-on speech to the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Putin launched a scathing attack on US interventionism and unilateralism, making clear Russia’s rejection of the US-led post-Cold War order. The speech touched only briefly on the Middle East but where it did, Putin once again stressed the need for stability:

The increasing social tension in depressed regions inevitably results in the growth of radicalism, extremism, feeds terrorism and local conflicts. And if all this happens in, shall we say, a region such as the Middle East where there is increasingly the sense that the world at large is unfair, then there is the risk of global destabilisation.60

The Medvedev Interregnum
In May 2008, Putin’s designated successor, Dmitry Medvedev, took over as president while Putin slid into Medvedev’s old job as prime minister, thus respecting the constitution’s two-term limit. As a leading light of the Kremlin’s liberal wing, Medvedev was thought to want closer ties with the West and more focus on economic development, but it was not clear how much power he had. Putin continued to wield influence from behind the scenes and was widely believed to be planning to retake the presidency in 2012, which in fact he did.
Friction with the United States and Europe continued to grow during Medvedev’s single term as president. In 2008, a brief war with Georgia drew Western condemnation and sent a chill through Russia’s European neighbors. The war also prompted a major military build-up. Although Russia had easily defeated Georgia, a much smaller country, the performance of its armed forces had been lackluster. Flush with oil wealth, the Kremlin responded by initiating the “most radical military reform since the creation of the Red Army,” drawing up an unprecedented 19 trillion ruble ($635 billion) budget for 2011–2020.61 The aim was to modernize the military in line with a longerterm goal of creating a “combat-ready force consisting of contracted professionals.”62
Russia’s military spending spree primarily sought to make up for two decades of neglect, but the reforms also reflected the Kremlin’s “broadly consistent, albeit pessimistic, strategic assumptions” about a “Hobbesian” future riven by sub-state strife,

extremist ideologies, hybrid and transnational threats and intensified greatpower resource competition.63 In such a world, Russia would need both a powerful deterrent force and a capacity for quick deployment in troublespots beyond its borders.
While there was no specific Middle Eastern element to the military build-up, it did call for a restored blue-water navy and for a Russian military presence in the Mediterranean.64 That brought renewed attention to the dilapidated refueling station at Tartous in Syria, and by 2008 a repair and expansion program was under way.65 Still reeling from events in Iraq and Lebanon and in acute need of major allies, Assad could not have been more eager to comply. On a visit to Russia in 2008, he praised the Russian operation in Georgia as a “defense of its legitimate interests” and called for a larger Russian role in Syria and the Middle East.66 Two years later, with new arms contracts concluded, Medvedev traveled to Damascus for the first-ever visit to Syria by a Russian president.
Russia and the Arab Spring
The wave of uprisings that rolled across the Arab World in early 2011 were certain to attract the attention of Russia, a nation bound to the Middle East by “numerous invisible threads.”67 Whereas many US and European politicians rallied enthusiastically to the side of the protestors, envisioning a youthful democracy movement patterned

on the European revolutions of 1989, Russia’s leaders read the situation quite differently. To them, the Arab uprisings seemed both more complex and more sinister: a chaotic rupturing of a stagnant and flawed socio-political order, likely to provoke long-term unrest, extremism, and perhaps interstate wars. The situation was not a 1989, but maybe an 1848.
Russian media was filled with conspiracy theories portraying the uprisings as nefarious color revolutions hatched in the United States. This line of reasoning apparently had some takers in the Kremlin, too, but senior Russian officials generally took a more sober view. For example, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov highlighted the Arab World’s social and political gridlock as a proximate cause of the upheaval, although he noted that external interests had quickly “superimposed” themselves on internal contradictions.68
Putin, who was still prime minister, bluntly pointed the finger at Western governments over what he saw as their naive encouragement of revolutionary change in a region that was not ready for it. “Let’s take a look back at history, if you don’t mind,” he told reporters in February 2011:
Where did Khomeini, the mastermind of the Iranian revolution, live? He lived in Paris. And he was supported by most of Western society. And now the West is facing the Iranian nuclear programme. I remember our partners calling for fair democratic elections in the Palestinian territories. Excellent!

Those elections were won by Hamas. They declared it a terrorist organisation and confronted it shortly thereafter.69
“Look at the current situation in the Middle East and the Arab world,” Medvedev told a counterterrorism meeting in February 2011, when the regional upheaval was still in its early stages:
It is extremely difficult and great problems still lie ahead. In some cases it may even come to the disintegration of large, heavily populated states, their break-up into smaller fragments. The character of these states is far from straightforward. It may come to very complex events, including the arrival of fanatics into power.
Medvedev then struck a more conspiratorial note, which appeared to reference Chechnya and the color revolution narrative:
In the past such a scenario was harboured for us, and now attempts to implement it are even more likely. In any case, this plot will not work. But everything that happens there will have a direct impact on our domestic situation in the long term, as long as decades.70
Moscow’s lack of enthusiasm for the Arab Spring included the early uprisings in January and February 2011 that toppled Tunisian President Zein al-Abidine Ben Ali and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, despite the fact that both men were longstanding Western allies.

“It was clear that the subject of Islamists was a fundamental obstacle to Russia, which preferred regimes not allied to itself in Egypt and Tunisia over [the prospect of] a democratic regime that carried a risk of Islamists coming to power,” concluded Azmi Bishara, a Palestinian politician and intellectual who, during the Arab Spring, worked hand in glove with the Qatari government to support dissidents in Syria and elsewhere.71However, the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt did not directly affect Russia’s economic or political position. Despite the president’s ominous rhetoric, official Russia did not seem to be in a panic, and there was anyway little that Moscow could do to influence events in either country.
The uprisings in Libya and Syria, which erupted in February and March 2011, were a different matter. Both nations had a Cold War history with Russia, but Moscow reacted not so much in solidarity with the incumbents as in vehement revulsion at their opponents. To Russia, the forces challenging Gaddafi and Assad appeared to be disorderly, US-backed, color revolutionstyle rebellions with a strong Sunni Islamist streak – a nightmarish cocktail of everything the Russian national security elite had been primed to fear and oppose since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
The Libyan Turning Point
On instructions from President Medvedev, Russia abstained in the March 2011 vote on UN Security Council Resolution 1973, which empowered member states to “take all necessary measures […] to protect civilians” in Libya. Western and Gulf Arab nations went to war as soon as the text was passed,

and France, the United Kingdom, and Qatar played early lead roles in what had soon evolved into a NATO-led operation to overthrow Gaddafi. Russia did not take part in the hostilities, but its abstention was crucial to passing the resolution.
“Mr Gaddafi did not have many friends anywhere in the world, including in Russia, but everyone loved Libya for its oil reserves and other riches,” says Dmitri Trenin of the Carnegie Moscow Center, summarizing the Kremlin’s attitude: “So we’ll join with the West and we’ll be among the winners in that war and we’ll get our share of the spoils.”72
As Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov noted later, however, the Russian government “had more than one opinion” on how to handle the Libyan crisis, and the main dissenter was none other than Vladimir Putin.73 Even though the prime minister had no formal role in foreign policy, Putin informed reporters that in his “personal opinion,” resolution 1973 was akin to “a medieval call to crusade” that would endanger Russia by encouraging US interventionism.74 Medvedev fired back: he took full responsibility for the vote and said talk of a crusade was “unacceptable.”75 Putin backed down but continued to grumble over what he allegedly considered an “unforgivable sign of weakness” on Medvedev’s part.76 Soon enough, Russia

began to protest the bombings in Libya, and its diplomats claimed that the West had willfully misinterpreted resolution 1973. Medvedev later joined the chorus of critics, complaining that he had been exposed to a “cynical deception at the UN Security Council round-table.”77
The argument was transparently insincere – Russian diplomats were skilled enough to understand the significance of a phrase like “all necessary measures.” Russia’s behavior was nonetheless perplexing. Al Jazeera’s Moscow bureau chief, Jamal al-Erdawi, asked: “How is it conceivable that the Russian Foreign Ministry with all its accumulated expertise in dealing with the West and its policies could not read the situation after the no fly zone in Libya.”78
Some observers have interpreted the disagreement between Putin and Medvedev as political theatrics, but that does little to explain what Russia was trying to achieve by permitting the intervention. By contrast, the Russian journalist Mikhail Zygar views the Libya vote as a sincere disagreement and places it as the starting point of a rift with personal, factional, and ideological dimensions that culminated in Putin’s September 2011 announcement that he would seek a third term.79

By then, Gaddafi’s regime was crumbling. The Libyan leader was dragged out of hiding and killed by rebels in October 2011. As no functioning government stood ready to take his place, Libya sank into failed state status, torn between hyper-local militias, Islamist radicalism, and proxy conflicts. If Russia (or Medvedev) had wagered that allowing a Western intervention would bring rewards, that bet failed.80 “In the end the Russians got nothing from this operation. They saw how this, in their own thinking, very magnanimous and very friendly gesture was taken for granted,” Trenin says. “There was this bitter feeling of being used, of being duped, of being sidelined.”81
Nationalist-Authoritarian Retrenchment
The Russian parliamentary elections of December 2011 were widely seen as a dress rehearsal for Putin’s re-election as president in the following spring. It was therefore all the more disturbing to the prime minister when allegations of vote-rigging drew large crowds of angry demonstrators on to the streets of Moscow. The demonstrations raised the specter of a popular protest movement forming in time for the presidential polls. To Putin and his allies, a Russian color revolution appeared to be in the making, perhaps with the support of disgruntled elements around Medvedev.82 In early December, the prime minister lashed out at US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,

accusing her of having instigated the protests.83
Putin safely regained the presidency in March 2012 and the demonstrations petered out. Even so, the combination of real and perceived threats in 2011 and 2012 accelerated the authoritarian and nationalist turn already under way in Russia. New legislative and bureaucratic measures to control politics and shore up internal security have since been adopted at a “startling rate,” while official rhetoric and domestic propaganda have promoted nationalist, anti-Western themes.84 Narratives about Russia as a beleaguered island of common sense and conservative values, defending itself and the principle of national sovereignty against the West’s nihilistic and hegemonic impulses have become central to how the Kremlin describes international affairs.85
In terms of foreign policy, “the watershed moment really is the Arab Spring,” according to Hanna Notte, a specialist on Russian foreign policy. After March 2011, Moscow’s quest for economic gain slid down the ladder of priorities in the Middle East and national security-related goals rose to the top. This transformed Russian Middle East policy into “a pro-status quo, anti-color revolution policy.”86

“The very notion of state sovereignty is being washed out,” Putin complained at a meeting of Russia’s Security Council in 2014. “Undesirable regimes, countries that conduct an independent policy or that simply stand in the way of somebody’s interests get destabilised. Tools used for this purpose are the so-called colour revolutions, or, in simple terms—takeovers instigated and financed from the outside.” “Security Council meeting,” Russian Presidency, July 22, 2014, en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/46305.

Syria as a Problem and an Opportunity
Protests erupted in Syria in March 2011, just before the Libyan intervention. By the time US President Barack Obama and his allies called on Assad to step aside in August 2011, the Kremlin had already resolved “not to let Syria become another Libya.”87
Already in the first weeks of Syrian demonstrations, a pro-opposition bloc crystallized around the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar, as well as several other Western or Sunni Arab governments. For Russia to join Iran on Assad’s side was hardly unproblematic, given that Russian diplomats had spent two decades trying to woo some of the nations in the proopposition bloc, but Putin never seems to have wavered: “Far from shying away from the Syrian crisis, Russia sought to play a leading role,” concludes Christopher Phillips in The Battle for Syria, a book on the international dimension of Syria’s civil war.88
The Kremlin’s strong pro-Assad stance seemed to be motivated by a combination of factors, chief among them a visceral rejection of any US-backed regime change. There was also a perceived need, after Libya, to prove Russia’s reliability as an ally, and a desire to protect lingering economic and strategic interests, such as arms sales and the Tartous base. To these were added a strong mistrust of the Syrian opposition and hostility toward its armed elements,

There are reports that the Russian authorities tolerated the flow of Russian jihadis to Syria in the early stages of the war, hoping to rid themselves of remaining Caucasus insurgents in this way and, perhaps, to avoid trouble at the February 2014 Sochi Olympics. However, by the latter half of 2014 – after the rise of IS – the authorities clamped down hard on what remained of the insurgency. International Crisis Group 2016, pp. 16–18.

some of which had links to extremists in Russia, as well as a fear that the likely consequence of Assad’s fall would be either direct Islamist rule or an ungoverned space that would allow extremists to organize.89
To prevent either outcome, Russia seemed prepared to support almost any type of behavior by the Syrian government, which bombed civilian targets and ‘disappeared’ thousands of citizens.90 Officially, Russia insisted that its commitment was to international law and to the Syrian state, not to Assad personally. Numerous USRussian meetings and attempts to engineer a peace process took place on that basis, but US officials later concluded that Moscow’s willingness talk about a political transition was just a way of stringing them along.
“Their main goal was to prevent regime change and keep Assad in power, and they humored us with discussions about governance and other stuff,” recalled Philip Gordon, who coordinated Obama’s Middle East Policy from 2013 to 2015. “We tried to proactively say, what about this, or how about this list of potential leaders? And they would say, yeah whatever. In retrospect what’s clear is they wanted us to be defeated, they wanted to maintain a heavy Russian role, they wanted to prevent regime change, they wanted to fight jihadis. And Putin’s counterterrorism recipe is quite well known – bomb them.”91

Russia and the United States jointly agreed to eliminate Assad’s chemical weapon stockpile through the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), as an alternative to US airstrikes. The deal eventually succeeded in destroying 1300 tonnes of chemicals, and there briefly seemed to be a chance to put US-Russian relations on a sounder footing. Reports of cheating and of sporadic chemical weapon use persisted, however, and Russia blocked every US attempt to hold Assad accountable.92 In the end, the episode created more ill-will than sustained collaboration.
Even before the chemical weapons deal had run its course, Russian-Western relations

had deteriorated dramatically for reasons unrelated to the Middle East. In the spring of 2014, Russia invaded and forcibly annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, bringing Russian-Western relations to their lowest point since the Cold War. The United States and the EU responded with economic sanctions, but Putin doubled down on what Ingmar Oldberg has characterized as a “mainly revisionist” foreign policy, seeking to upend elements of the post-1991 status quo and reassert a global role for Russia.93 Increasingly, Syria, too, was framed in terms of Russian national interests – and in 2015 a Foreign Ministry spokesperson announced that a Libyan-style state failure in Syria would be “a direct threat to our national security.”94

The Russian Intervention
Russia launched an aerial intervention in Syria on September 30, 2015. Publicly, Russian diplomats cited the threat from the Islamic State (IS), a jihadi group that had seized large areas of Syria and Iraq in the summer of 2014 and which was already under attack from a US-led intervention. In practice, Russian jets bombed anyone who happened to stand in Assad’s way. Regional reactions were predictably mixed.
“Victories are not declared at the start of the war,” cautioned Ghassan Charbel, editor-in-chief of the Saudi-owned al-Hayat newspaper, adding, “It is difficult to imagine” that Putin “is planning to crush the entire Syrian opposition even at the cost of ruining his country’s ties to the Sunni world.”95
Ibrahim al-Amin of al-Akhbar, a Lebanese daily sympathetic to Hezbollah and Iran, was more enthusiastic: “Yesterday, Russia turned a new page in the history of the world.” But Amin also warned that the war was far from over and that allies of Assad and Iran should not misunderstand Russia’s motives: Moscow was acting as a “a supportive party, not a member of the resistance axis.”96
In Egypt’s al-Shurouq, the influential political journalist Fahmi Howeidi warned that Putin was stepping into a “swamp of blood,” but took note of the fact that the intervention had changed the rules of the game: Assad could no longer be overthrown

militarily, and Russia would have a say in any future political deal.97
Many Arab commentators also viewed the intervention in terms of Moscow reclaiming a long-lost regional role. The veteran Egyptian pundit Mohammed Hassanein Heikal argued that Putin had exploited US weakness and European distraction to engineer, through Syria, a “restoration of the glory of the Soviet state.”98
The intervention had certainly sent a signal about Russia’s enhanced military capabilities. Characterized by “remarkable speed and sophisticated planning,” the move into Syria appeared to be a testament to the effectiveness of its 2011–2020 military reforms.99 “Moscow would not have intervened in the Middle East if it had not had the toolbox,” notes Trenin, and it is hard to escape the conclusion that Syria must have seemed like a highly suitable nail for the Kremlin’s brand new hammer.100
While the intervention’s direct objectives were clear enough – save Assad, kill Islamists – it also seemed to have an international political component. RussianWestern relations were in the deep freeze due to the annexation of Crimea, and the one issue on which Russia had enjoyed the status it sought, the P5+1 Group’s nuclear talks with Iran, had wrapped up earlier in the year. By intervening in Syria, Russia hoped to prove its mettle as a great power actor, box in the United States politically and “broaden the confrontation [with the West] on terms more favorable to itself.”101 Ultimately, the goal was to force “a

lukewarm friendship” on Washington without having to surrender gains in either Ukraine or Syria.102
Throughout late 2015 and 2016, the US administration found itself pelted with repeated Russian proposals on how to merge the two aerial interventions into a single anti-jihadi alliance. These were rejected out of hand. Washington had no interest in bestowing legitimacy on Putin’s Syrian project and viewed Russia’s bombardment of US-backed rebels as a hostile act, not a platform for collaboration. If Putin had sincerely believed he could use Syria to reset the broken relationship, it was a baffling misreading of Washington’s perspective – made all the more ironic by the US failure to understand the Kremlin’s ambitions in Syria.
While Russia did not get the recognition and cooperation it sought, it did turn the war around. Russian military tactics met with strong criticism from Western governments and human rights groups. Amnesty International warned of “horrific violations” of human rights.103 Moscow brushed off the criticism, however, and its methods, while brutal, proved effective. In late 2016, Assad’s forces won a highly symbolic victory in the city of Aleppo.104 “The disintegration of the Syrian state was prevented and the chain of colour revolutions that multiplied in the Middle East and Africa was cut short,”

Putin told a meeting of Defense Ministry officials.105
Shortly thereafter, the new US President, Donald J. Trump, began to scale back US involvement in Syria. Although the conflict continues to demand Moscow’s attention, Russia appears to have secured a strategic victory for itself and for Assad. The material costs have been limited and so far remain bearable, even considering Russia’s financial problems.106 In so doing, Russia has defended and expanded its foothold in the eastern Mediterranean by securing longterm control of the Tartous naval facility and adding a nearby airbase at Hmeymim.107
Flipping Turkey
Russian success in Syria was not just a military endeavor. The political effects of the intervention were no less important, as Russia forced external backers of anti-Assad forces either to fall in line or to get out of the way. Jordan’s King Abdullah II, a grudging supporter of the rebels, to whom the Syrian war seemed a hopeless mess, immediately called for the Russian presence to be dealt with constructively, which, he said, offered “an opportunity to move this in the right direction.”108
The most consequential change, however, came from Turkish President Recep Tayyip

Erdogan. Initially a fierce opponent of the Russian presence, his air defenses had downed a Russian Su-24 alleged to have crossed into Turkish airspace in November 2015, raising fears of a Russia-NATO clash. Instead of responding directly to the incident, Moscow ramped up its bombing of Turkish-backed Syrian rebels. Economic sanctions were instituted that nearly halved Russian-Turkish trade between 2014 and 2016, dealing a serious blow to Turkey’s already ailing economy.109 As in the 1990s, Russia also played the Kurdish card, apparently delivering one or several antiaircraft missiles to PKK rebels for use against military aircraft in Turkey.110
By the early summer of 2016, Turkey had had enough. Erdogan no longer saw a path to victory in Syria and faced a bigger problem: the United States had thrown its support behind pro-PKK Kurdish groups in the war on IS. According to persistent rumors, Russia had also provided timely assistance in staving off a coup against Erdogan in July 2016.
Turkish-Russian hostility transformed into wary cooperation as Russia facilitated a series of Turkish military interventions and Turkey redirected its rebel clients toward Syrian PKK sympathizers.111 By 2017, Russia, Turkey, and Iran were holding regular talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana, trading favors to steer the war’s endgame. The unspoken assumption seemed to be that Assad had won, but that Turkey might still hang on to certain border territories in the absence of a satisfying political resolution.112

Putin has argued that the 2015 intervention staved off the worst possible outcome, not just for Russia but for the region and the world:
Full ‘somalisation’ of that region, complete degradation of statehood and infiltration of a significant part of the militants into the territory of the Russian Federation and into the territory of neighbouring states with which we have no customs barriers, or borders in fact, a visa-free regime [i.e., Turkey]. That would have posed a real, serious danger to us. But we have largely ruled out that risk by our actions, because we did a lot of damage to the terrorists in Syria […and…] we have preserved Syrian statehood and in this sense helped stabilise the region.113
After Syria: Taking Stock of Russia’s New Role
Eight years after the Arab Spring, the Middle East is still seeking a new balance. Libya and Yemen have crumbled and could remain failed states indefinitely. Syria has broken apart into rival territories: Assad is in control of most of what matters but so far unable to reclaim the rest. Lebanon wallows in internal dysfunction but, like Jordan, has at least avoided a major breakdown. Iraq is still fragile after defeating IS, and Turkey struggles with a faltering economy and

tense internal politics under Erdogan’s increasingly authoritarian rule.
In the Gulf region, the old rivalry between Qatar, on the one hand, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, on the other, has been fiercer than ever since 2017. Meanwhile, Iran’s power has grown across the region, even though the Iranian economy is in terrible shape due to US sanctions.
Israel’s military and political position has improved, but the country struggles to roll back Iranian influence in Syria and is internally drifting deeper into far-right ethno-politics in the absence of a solution to the Palestinian issue.
In North Africa, President Abdel-Fattah elSisi’s iron-fisted rule remains at risk due to Egypt’s poor economic performance. Maghrebi giants Algeria and Morocco have changed little, but attempts to ram through a fifth term for Algeria’s elderly and ailing president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, drew protestors on to the streets in early 2019. In Sudan, too, the economic distress that followed the secession of oil-rich South Sudan in 2011 has triggered major protests. Tunisia’s fragile democracy still splutters on but the country is struggling to stay afloat economically.
In short, the region is not in a healthy state and Russia’s leaders appear to feel fully vindicated in their early opposition to the Arab Spring.114 Nonetheless, Russia has in some ways profited from the chaos of the post-2011 period.
114 “Unsuccessful attempts to spread Western models of
democracy to a social environment that is not suited for this have resulted in the demise of entire states and have turned huge territories into zones of hostility,” Medvedev complained in 2016.

Through Syria, Moscow has established itself as an active regional player with a “simultaneous ability to speak to every regional government while also possessing visible coercive power.”115 This influence has since spread beyond Syria, but Russia’s lack of economic muscle is making it difficult to sustain new relationships and ambitions in the longer term.
“The bigger picture shows that politically, yes, there’s a lot of progress, but it’s not necessarily linked to real stuff that you can measure economically,” argues Yury Barmin of the Russian International Affairs Council. “But maybe Vladimir Putin capitalizing on his influence in the Middle East financially is not the goal itself – maybe the optics of a huge presence is the end goal?”116
The Gulf Arab Nations
Fears that Russia’s relations with the Sunni monarchies in the Gulf would collapse over its support for the “Shia” camp of Damascus, Tehran and Hezbollah have proved unfounded. On the contrary, relations have intensified. Although unhappy about many of Russia’s policy choices, Gulf Arab leaders have concluded that Moscow is an assertive and relevant power that must be engaged with constructively. They place value on Russia’s “support for political stability and economic engagement without any human rights conditionality” and, with the exception of Qatar, share Moscow’s disdain for the Arab Spring.117

Salman since 2015. In a move symbolic of Riyadh’s decision to engage with Russia despite disagreements over Syria and Iran, King Salman became the first Saudi monarch to visit Moscow in late 2017. Commenting on the visit, Salman alDawsari, the editor-in-chief of the royal family’s al-Sharq al-Awsat daily, noted that “the return of the Russian bear” to the Middle East had provoked sharp disagreements over issues like Syria, but insisted that both nations “prefer to focus on the shared interests that exist on promising issues rather than on disagreements.”118
For Saudi Arabia, constructive engagement with Russia is in part intended to prevent closer Russian alignment with Iran or Qatar. Saudi Arabia also shares Russia’s preference for a region kept stable by pragmatic, nonIslamist autocrats; Egypt’s Sisi is a model for what both sides can live with. Last but not least, both nations depend on high oil prices. Russia-Saudi Arabia cooperation in late 2018 was instrumental in bringing down the global output of crude oil by 1.4 million barrels per day, thereby increasing market prices.119
Beyond top-level deals over oil production, however, Russian-Saudi trade is meager. Russia accounted for just 0.2 percent of Saudi foreign trade in 2016 and its investments in the Saudi Arabian economy were “insignificant.”120 “For some reason [Russian businessmen and officials] can’t break that glass ceiling and it’s really hard to

follow through on these deals,” says Barmin. “A lot of promises but not much work, to be honest.”121
Some Gulf leaders appear to be using Moscow to extract favors from their main patron, the United States, and the SaudiEmirati conflict with Qatar has also spurred both sides to compete for the Kremlin’s favor. All three nations are in talks about buying Russian arms, and Qatar made a rare, major investment in the Russian oil company Rosneft in 2016.122 Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, who appears to see Russia as a fellow proponent of authoritarian antiIslamism, has jetted back and forth from Moscow.123
Even so, Russian hopes for closer ties with the Gulf Arabs will struggle to overcome countervailing pressures from the United States and Russia’s own lack of attractiveness as an economic partner. While cooperation might intensify in certain political and economic niches, Moscow seems unable to compete with the depth and breadth of US penetration of the Gulf region.
Egypt
In Egypt, Russia faces some of the same obstacles as in the Gulf but seems to be making more headway. Although Putin pragmatically sought good relations with Mohammed Morsi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood democratically elected

president in 2012, he immediately embraced Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi’s 2013 military coup and has continued to praise the Egyptian president since. “Just look,” Putin told reporters in 2014, “there are problems in Afghanistan; Iraq is falling apart; Libya is falling apart. If General el-Sisi had not taken control in Egypt, Egypt would probably be in turmoil now as well.”124
Sisi’s main backers are the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, but Russia was the first country to invite Sisi for a state visit after the coup, for which the Egyptian president later thanked Putin.125 Moscow also stepped in to sell arms when Washington froze part of its military assistance to the Egyptian Army in October 2013.126 Putin and Sisi have met nine times since 2013, and several so-called 2+2 meetings have been held between the countries’ foreign and defense ministers.127
Egyptian-Russian relations were complicated in October 2015 when IS bombed a Russian aircraft flying from Sharm al-Sheikh to St Petersburg, killing 225 people.128 Egyptian authorities initially refused to admit that the aircraft had been bombed, prompting Moscow to shut down tourist air travel – a painful blow to Egypt’s already ailing economy. In February 2016 Sisi backed down, but flights did not resume

until 2018 due to continuing Russian complaints about Egypt’s capacity to guarantee safe air travel.129 Some suspect that Moscow may have used the tourism ban to win concessions on security affairs.130
Russia appears to be focused on economic gain and security affairs, but may also see symbolic value in rebuilding the relationship with Cairo. Egypt, in turn, sees the possibility of reducing its dependence on the United States, which in the eyes of its current leadership proved an unreliable ally in 2011, and of profiting from a meeting of minds with Putin over regional affairs. Sisi’s “Egypt First” policies combine anti-Islamism and nationalism with a fixation on regional stability and national sovereignty, which is an excellent match with Russia’s own regional priorities.131
What Egypt primarily needs is economic support, which Russia is not in a position to provide. Nonetheless, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have extended billions of dollars in economic support to Egypt since 2013, and Russia is keen to get a slice of the pie.132 In practice, Russian trade with Egypt has been dominated by arms sales, grain exports, and an agreement that Rosatom will build Egypt’s first nuclear reactor, which has been celebrated by both countries as an important milestone.133

Security cooperation has also intensified, and there have been major arms deliveries and small but symbolic joint military exercises since 2016.134 Russia and Egypt have even discussed a deal that would give Russia some form of access to Egyptian airbases.135 However, Egypt has thus far been careful to maintain its post-Sadat partnership with Washington, and Sisi’s outreach to Russia appears to represent an attempt to diversify rather than abandon its relationship with the United States.
Counterterrorism is another area of joint interest, not least in the light of the 2015 aircraft bombing. Like many other nations, Russia is concerned about threats to Egypt’s internal order and views a stable Egypt as a cornerstone of Middle East security. Since the 2013 coup, Islamist violence has killed around 1400 members of the Egyptian security forces, which, in turn, have killed many times that number in a counterterrorism campaign marked by inefficiency and heavy-handedness.136 Russia has nonetheless offered full-throated support for Sisi. For instance, Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev lauded the Egyptian president’s efforts to “drive back that epidemic” during a visit to Cairo in the spring of 2019.137
Foreign policy also offers room for cooperation. Although Egypt does not officially take sides in the Syria conflict, Sisi clearly leans toward Assad and is hostile to the Islamist-dominated Syrian insurgency, which includes Muslim Brotherhood

members and a smattering of exiled Egyptian jihadis. In 2016, Sisi implicitly endorsed the Assad government by stating that “Arab national armies” should “impose control over their state territories and restore stability” in Libya, Syria, and Iraq.138 Russia consequently supports Egyptian attempts to get involved in Syria’s peace processes and has pursued policies friendly to Egypt in Libya (see below).
On the occasion of Putin’s most recent visit in 2017, the official al-Ahram daily lauded Russia’s role and influence in the Middle East, noting that both countries want to see the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Iraq, and Yemen stabilized and have broadly similar views on the Israel-Palestine issue.139 For its part, Russia’s Gazeta.ru reported that Sisi had sought Putin’s support against Islamists in Libya and against the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. In an aside, the newspaper noted that Sisi’s translator had “accidentally or deliberately” addressed Putin as “Your Majesty,” which, when it happened for the third time, “caused a slight smile from the Russian leader.”140
Israel
Russia’s relationship with Israel has always been close and complicated, and the Syrian intervention has made it more so. On the one hand, 12 percent of Israel’s population speak Russian as their first language and Putin is “the most pro-Israel, pro-Jewish leader Russia has ever known.”141 On the other hand, Russia is now working closely

with Israel’s chief adversaries, Iran and Hezbollah, in Syria, dominating airspace in which Israel seeks freedom of action.
Despite its strong ties to the United States, Israel has gone to great lengths to remain friendly with Russia. To the frustration of its Western allies, Israeli diplomats refused to show up for a UN vote condemning the annexation of Crimea, and the Israeli Foreign Ministry issued only a vague statement about the Skripal poisoning in the United Kingdom.142
Since 2015, Russia has laid down a fairly generous set of red lines for Israel’s military activity in Syria. Israeli officials have claimed that the Russian military is helping to prevent Iran-Hezbollah arms smuggling through Syria to Lebanon, and IsraeliRussian understandings have allowed Israel to launch more than 200 airstrikes against alleged Iran- or Hezbollah-linked targets in Syria since early 2017.143 To the frustration of Damascus and Tehran, the Kremlin has apparently informed Israel that it is free to do as it pleases as long as this does not endanger Russian soldiers or destabilize Assad’s regime. Russia’s red line was put to the test in September 2018 when Syrian air defenses downed a Russian signals intelligence Il-20 off the Syrian coast during an Israeli raid, killing 15 crew members. Moscow blamed Israel for having triggered the incident and announced that it would retaliate by donating S-300 missiles to Syria. Until then, Russia had repeatedly threatened to deliver

the powerful air defense system to Syria but always ultimately held off from doing so in response to Israeli pressure and enticements.144
Israeli air raids in Syria soon picked up again, however, and neither side seemed willing to let the incident ruin relations. In February 2019, Putin finally agreed to meet Israel’s Prime Minister, Benyamin Netanyahu, after a six-month boycott. It was the 11th time the two leaders had met in person since Russia’s 2015 intervention, and the presence of foreign (Iranian and US) forces in Syria seems to have been high on the list of priorities discussed.145
The Palestinian Question
The Israel-Palestine question was once central to Soviet and Russian diplomacy in the Middle East but as international attention to the conflict faded after 2011, Russia’s active interest diminished somewhat. Moscow maintains a more or less even-handed view of the problem, benefiting from the Soviet Union’s proPalestinian legacy but now broadened by active engagement with Israel. Politically, Russia stays close to the EU position and to the concepts underlying the Oslo Agreement, often voicing its explicit commitment to a two-state solution and shared rights to Jerusalem. However, unlike most EU member states, Russia has no qualms about engaging with Hamas or other groups listed as terrorists by the United States and Europe, and it has

formally recognized Palestine as an independent state.146
In 2017, Moscow took the unusual step of recognizing West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, while maintaining that East Jerusalem should be the capital of Palestine.147 This is in line with PLO demands but most nations seeking a twostate solution have stuck to the UN formula that the status of Jerusalem remains a subject for final-status negotiations. Israel, for its part, claims the city in its entirety. When the United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, with no mention of a role for the Palestinians, the Russian Foreign Ministry criticized the US decision as a hindrance to peace talks.148
In November 2018, Lavrov indicated that Russia would be willing to host IsraeliPalestinian peace talks, apparently in an attempt to exploit the Trump administration’s inability to restart negotiations. Palestinian officials responded enthusiastically.149 Russia began to prepare for reconciliation talks between the two main Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas, but immediately ran into Israeli objections and Palestinian infighting. A scheduled visit to Russia by the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was postponed. When intra-Palestinian talks in Moscow finally began in February 2019, they involved the full range of factions – Fatah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the Liberation

of Palestine, Islamic Jihad, and so on – but the mood was fairly sour.150
Iran
Russian-Iranian relations have grown in depth and scope as the two countries have worked side by side to support Syria’s Assad, setting in motion a stream of diplomatic and military visits between Moscow and Tehran. The 2015 nuclear deal also removed an obstacle to closer engagement, and the Kremlin has aligned itself with Tehran since then. Predictably, Russia declared itself “deeply disappointed” by the US decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran in 2018.151
“The present relations between Russia and Iran are of a strategic nature,” Iranian President Hassan Rohani said during a meeting with Putin in 2018, adding, “There has never been such a level of trust between the two sides in the history of our countries as there is today.” Putin concurred but added that there was “still a lot to be done” to promote deeper economic ties.152
Indeed, while events in Syria have led Russia and Iran to develop ties of a kind never seen before, the economic side of the relationship remains feeble and has not improved in recent years. There are also sources of tension both inside and outside Syria, amplified by historical mistrust.

Iranians have not forgotten Soviet attempts to occupy and dismember Iran.
When Moscow announced in 2016 that it would be using Iran’s Hamdan airbase to strike targets in Syria, based on a deal previously undisclosed to the Iranian public, the authorities in Tehran faced an immediate nationalist backlash and were greatly irritated by Russia’s lack of diplomatic tact. The Iranian defense minister assured the public that “under no circumstances will we ever provide Russians with a military base. They have not come here to stay.”153 The affair ended with Russia being shut out of the base once again, although undeclared use may have resumed since.154
According to Barmin, “The Iran relationship only hinges on Putin’s desire to be closer to Iran in Syria”:
Of course there are all kinds of constraints here, in terms of sanctions and other things, but institutionalizing the ties with Iran is what Moscow failed to do and that’s a great miscalculation. I think after Syria, the relationship might go to shit, both due to differences in Syria and because there are still so many disagreements in other fields, including over gas and in Russia’s immediate backyard – Azerbajdzjan, Armenia, the Caspian Sea. All of these differences may resurface after Syria.155

Differences are already apparent, most notably over Russia’s attempts to build closer ties with Iran’s arch-enemies Israel and Saudi Arabia. Russia’s coordination of oil policy with Saudi Arabia appears to take advantage of sanctions on Iran, and Iranian leaders have not failed to note Moscow’s eagerness to sell advanced S-400 antiaircraft missile systems to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, even as Iran had to wait nearly a decade to get the less advanced S-300 system.156
Like Israel, Tehran attempts to compartmentalize its disagreements with Moscow, but often ends up having to accept that Russia refuses to pick sides, preferring instead to negotiate solutions on a case-bycase basis. For example, Tehran was frustrated when Russia approved a UN arms embargo against the Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen in 2015. Three years later, however, Iran was relieved to see Russia use its veto powers to kill a draft resolution that would have sanctioned Iran for breaching that same embargo.157
Although Iranian leaders often grumble about Moscow’s behavior, they “can’t cherry pick,” according to Dina Esfandiary, an expert on Iranian foreign policy: “They don’t have that many allies and they are still grateful to countries like Russia and China, because these are countries that have dealt with Iran in times of hardship without dangling human rights and their nuclear program as a condition.”158

Turkey
Russia’s most tangible gain from the Syrian conflict is probably Turkey’s political volteface in 2016, which has since translated into a rapid deepening of Russian-Turkish relations.159 Turkey’s turnaround was in large part provoked by US support for PKKlinked Syrian Kurdish militants and a general disenchantment with the United States, rather than any newfound affinity for Putin’s Russia. Nonetheless, RussianTurkish relations have continued to grow closer over time, and now seem to have developed a dynamic of their own as Erdogan doubles down on his anti-Western rhetoric.
“Much of Russian-Turkish diplomacy today appears to consist of an exercise in cleansing the relationship of Western influence,” Turkish political scientist Selim Koru wrote in a 2018 report. “Both countries seem to agree that Western influence is a silently imposed, malicious presence that poisons the daily lives of their citizens.”160
Trade has yet to recover from the sanctions imposed on Turkey by Russia in 2015–2017, but Putin and Erdogan now meet far more frequently than Erdogan and Trump, and their cooperation has expanded to military affairs. Turkey has signed an agreement to purchase Russian S-400 air defense systems, in the face of vehement US objections.161
Internally, Russia-friendly “Eurasianist” circles have reportedly gained a measure of influence in Turkey’s traditionally pro-US security establishment, partly due to the

massive purges that followed the attempted coup in July 2016. However, their relevance remains uncertain.
Through Syria, each country exercises some degree of leverage over the other. Russia needs Turkey to “freeze” frontlines with Ankara-backed rebel forces in northwestern Syria, and to push for a political solution that spares Assad. For its part, Turkey wants Russia to withhold support for renewed Syrian army offensives that could send additional hundreds of thousands of refugees into Turkey, and to support Turkish interests in northern Syria, such as border security, anti-PKK measures and perhaps a resumption of trade.162
However, their interests in each other extend far beyond Syria. Erdogan is using Russia to gain greater practical autonomy from the United States and, instrumentally, to pressure Washington to change its proKurdish policies. However, while ideology and anti-US nationalism should not be disregarded as genuine motives for Erdogan’s conduct, he is probably wary of sliding too deep into Russia’s embrace. In particular, if US forces were to withdraw from Syria in 2019, as has previously been suggested by Trump, this could pave the way for a reboot of the Turkish-US relationship.
If so, it would be a bitter setback for Moscow. Turkey matters greatly to Russia not just as a neighbor, a trading partner, and a major member of NATO, but also as a potential node in the “multipolar world order” that remains the stated goal of Russian foreign policy.163 Turkey’s 2016

policy flip was a precondition for the Astana process, which has, for the first time, allowed Russia to line up both of its major Middle East neighbors in a collaborative arrangement under Russian oversight. Given Russia’s longstanding strategic fixation on Iran and Turkey in the Middle East, Moscow would probably be thrilled to see an Astana-style arrangement broadened to include other regional issues. That, however, will be easier said than done, given the lack of a clear institutional basis for such cooperation and the numerous areas of disagreement between all three nations.
The International Level
Although Russia’s role in the Middle East has grown since the 2015 intervention, Putin’s Syrian adventure has produced somewhat more mixed results at the international level. The war has certainly helped raise Moscow’s political stature and bring back some of the great power flair lost in 1991, fulfilling one important goal of post-Soviet Russian foreign policy. It has also blunted the West’s appetite for regime change and proxy warfare in the Middle East, ticking another box on Russia’s policy score sheet. While winning in the Arab World is all well and good, however, Russia’s strategic vision remains fixated on the United States, and that relationship remains both troubled and unequal.
Defying Putin’s hopes in 2015, Syria has neither helped Russia transcend its disputes with the West over Ukraine, nor created meaningful leverage over the United States and Europe on other issues. Instead of changing its attitude to Russia, the United States is now simply withdrawing from the conflict, leaving Moscow in charge of a

messy, unstable situation that offers no obvious spoils to the victor. Meanwhile, Russian-Western ties continue to deteriorate on other matters, as evidenced by the 2019 collapse of the INF Treaty, a key piece in the US-Russian arms control architecture.
In so far as the Syrian conflict has contributed to the overall deterioration in relations with the United States and Europe, this may, in retrospect, come to outweigh any gains made in the Middle East. Putin remains defiant but by doubling down on confrontative, anti-Western policies, he may end up saddling Russia with political and financial commitments it cannot realistically sustain. Russia’s economy is hydrocarbon-dependent and weak, and Western sanctions have contributed to its dysfunctionality. Social discontent is once again becoming a real concern for the Kremlin, particularly after Putin’s 2018 roll-out of unpopular costcutting pensions reforms.164 Even the president’s pet budget item, the military, is now suffering cutbacks. In 2016, for the first time since Putin became president in 1999, Russia’s military expenditure was not increased. Instead, spending was slashed by 20 percent.165
Behind Russia’s ambitious regional posture and its triumphalist messaging there lies a sobering reality of weak economic foundations, a political/military footprint limited to specific countries and issues, and a lack of reliable and mutually beneficial alliances. Given that Russia also faces numerous other challenging problems, there is a hard limit to how much power Moscow can aspire to in the Middle East. The question is: does Putin recognize that limit?

Economic Interests Remain Key
In response to the imposition of US and EU sanctions, Russian policymakers have sought to boost trade with non-Western countries, including those in the Middle East. In 2019, for example, Russia’s Deputy Minister of Industry, Sergey Tsyb, announced that Russia hoped to sign free trade agreements with Israel, Iran and Egypt.166 However, Russian trade with the Middle East and North Africa region remains limited, at $45.5 billion, or 8 percent of Russia’s global trade, in 2017. Nearly half of this amount was RussianTurkish trade ($21.6bn), followed by trade with Egypt ($6.7bn), Algeria ($4.7bn), Israel ($2.5bn), Iran ($1.7bn), and the United Arab Emirates ($1.6bn).167 Russia’s economic activity in the region continues to focus on its traditional areas of strength: energy cooperation (oil, gas, nuclear) and Russian exports of arms and grain.
Oil, gas, and nuclear energy
Russia’s economy is highly dependent on oil and gas exports, which makes it sensitive to oil price fluctuations. Moscow therefore pays close attention to the energy markets. As one of the world’s three largest oil producers – the other two are the United States and Saudi Arabia – Russia has considerable influence over output and price.

In recent years, Russia has cooperated with OPEC, the oil producers’ cartel, of which it is not a member, to push prices up to around $60/barrel, which is Moscow’s preferred level. Russia has worked closely with Saudi Arabia on oil prices since 2017. By 2018– 2019, Russian-Saudi influence was such that OPEC members were complaining about being sidelined. Qatar and Iran seemed particularly perturbed.168 However, oil prices remain under pressure, and US production is projected to rise significantly in 2019 and 2020.169
Russia is also the world’s largest gas producer. Its exports to Europe serve both an economic and a strategic function. Gas prices are not as easy to manipulate as oil prices; gas markets are not global, but regional and tied to transport routes such as pipelines. Nonetheless, Moscow has long sought increased coordination with leading regional exporters such as Qatar, Iran, and Algeria. However, while energy creates opportunities for cooperation, Russia also fears competition. For example, Moscow is worried that Iran might undercut its hold on European markets. Russia has repeatedly offered to invest in pipeline projects that would see Iranian gas move east to Pakistan rather than west to Europe.170
Turkey is a major buyer of Russian gas, exporting some onwards to the EU. Two Russian pipelines cross Turkish territory: BlueStream, constructed between 1997 and 2005, and TurkStream, which, after a delay

due to Russian-Turkish friction over Syria, is set to be operational by the end of 2019.171
Russia’s state-owned Rosatom company is also the undisputed world leader in nuclear power plant construction, although it is starting to face competition from China. The Middle East has become a significant market. Rosatom has already built the Bushehr reactor in Iran and is now constructing a nuclear power plant in Turkey, in a contract worth $20 billion. The company has also signed deals to construct reactors in Egypt and Sudan.172
Military exports
The arms trade has been an important part of Moscow’s relationship with the Middle East and North Africa region since Soviet times. While most Soviet-era exports took the form of politically motivated donations, sales on long-term credit, or loans that were rarely repaid, Russia sells weapons for a profit.
The Middle East-North Africa region is a sizable market for Russian arms, accounting for roughly one-fifth of exports in 2013– 2017.173 However, Russia still lags far behind the United States in overall weapons deliveries to the Middle East, given the enormous purchases of US arms by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab nations.174

Algeria has long been Russia’s most important customer in the region, and one of the most important globally. According to SIPRI, Algeria was the world’s thirdlargest importer of Russian arms in the 20year period 1997–2017, albeit well behind the top two importers, India and China. Two other Middle East states, Iran and Egypt, ranked sixth and seventh.175 In recent years, Algeria has imported Russian T-90 tanks, Su-30 fighter jets, S-300 air defenses, Iskander ballistic missiles and other highend equipment.176 In total, four-fifths of Russia’s arms exports to Africa in 2013–2017 went to Algeria.177
The Syrian intervention has served as a marketing opportunity for Russia, which has publicly advertised its weapons as tested on the Syrian battlefield.178 Russian analysts estimated in 2016 that the intervention could bring a $6–7 billion windfall in weapon sales, both as a demonstrator of military technology and by casting Russia in the role of a victorious great power, since “people don’t buy weapons from losers.”179 Arms sales have indeed picked up since 2015 and new clients – such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates – have declared an interest in buying Russian arms. Breaking into the Gulf markets would be an important step forward for Russia.

According to SIPRI, the Middle East (which is defined as including Egypt) accounted for 11 percent of Russian arms export in 2013–2017 and Africa for another 13 percent. Of sales to Africa, four fifths went to North African nations (78 percent to Algeria, 1 percent to Libya).

Grain
After a decade of increasing sales, Russia emerged as the world’s top wheat exporter in 2016, aided by a genuine increase in capacity and the fact that the slump in the ruble has helped Russian traders outcompete more expensive EU grain. Export revenues from agriculture topped $20 billion in 2017 and grain sales have overtaken arms as a source of income for

Russia, leading a former agriculture minister to quip that it has become the country’s “second oil.”180
Several major importers of Russian grain are found in the Middle East, in Egypt, Turkey and, more recently, Sudan. Russia also hopes to break into the large Algerian market, which until now has been a virtual French monopoly.181

will damage ecosystems and affect crop production. Some of these problems helped trigger the Arab Spring, but they have not been resolved by it. Instead, the situation is now worse in many ways.
Russia’s bleak view of the region’s future incentivizes continued engagement, to promote stability and to knock down new threats as they arise, but also because regional needs create opportunities for Russian exports. The success in Syria, such as it is, also appears to have created a new appetite for involvement for involvement’s sake.
Russia and Libya
In Libya, which remains in chaos, Russia has joined Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in backing Field Marshal Khalifa Heftar, a powerful eastern Libyan warlord whose bid for power doubles as an anti-Islamist campaign.182 Unconfirmed reports in late 2018 claimed that Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers had set up camp in eastern Libya alongside mercenaries from the Wagner Group (see below).183
However, Russia is not wedded to Heftar. Its “very prudent” policy focuses on practical gain and includes maintaining relations with Heftar’s Islamist opponents in Tripoli, “because that is where the dough is.”184 Casting a wide net, Russia declared in late 2018 that it even sees a role for Gaddafi’s son, Seif al-Islam, in Libya’s future. “We
182 As a colonel in the Libyan army, Heftar defected from
Gaddafi’s forces in the 1980s and went into exile in the United States, where he was widely assumed to be working with the CIA. In 2011, he returned to Libya alongside the NATO intervention forces, emerging as one of several strongmen in the Benghazi region of eastern Libya. In recent years, Heftar – now styling himself as field marshal – spearheaded an Egyptian- and Emirati-backed offensive against jihadi and Muslim Brotherhood influence, unsuccessfully attempting to topple a rival Islamistled, Qatari-backed government in Tripoli. 183
See e.g. Tom Newton Dunn, “Putin Troops in Libya,” The Sun, October 8, 2018, https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/7448072/russia-missiles-libyawarlord; Paul Goble, “Moscow Laying Groundwork for Deeper Military Involvement in Libya,” Eurasia Monitor-Jamestown Foundation, November 13, 2018,

support everyone. We don’t think anyone should be isolated or excluded from playing a constructive political role,” Deputy Foreign Minister Bogdanov explained, adding, “Seif al-Islam enjoys the support of certain tribes in Libya and for all these reasons he must be a part of the comprehensive political process in partnership with other political forces.”185
Russian engagement in Libya appears to serve a variety of interests that do not necessarily amount to a full-fledged strategy or long-term plan. Working with Heftar helps to grease relations with Egypt and the Emirates and might give Moscow some independent leverage. Libya’s role as a major oil producer and a jumping-off point for refugee ships makes the country important to Europe, which is another reason to stay involved. However, even though Russia has signaled that it could mediate between Libya’s rival forces, it has so far produced nothing resembling a plan to put Libya back together again.186 Russian diplomats and analysts appear to see Libya as “completely unripe for any sort of resolution.”187 Should that change, Libya might conceivably develop into another area where the Kremlin tries to enlist Western and Arab nations in a joint effort, both to promote common goals (such as Libyan stability) and to reconfigure its relationship with Brussels and Washington.

Russia and Lebanon
Libya is in some senses an engagement of choice, but Russia’s growing influence in the Middle East has also created new liabilities and side issues that need to be addressed. Although Lebanon is in itself of limited importance to Moscow, the country plays an outsized role in the national security strategies of Syria, Iran and Israel; and, as it drifts closer to Iran and Syria, it offers an environment more friendly to Russia than in the past. Hezbollah’s growing influence could trigger internal instability and spark wars with Israel, which is also a matter of concern to Russia.
Since 2015, Russia has deepened its contacts with Lebanese politicians and business owners, including Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri. It has opened several Russian cultural centers in Lebanon and is working to repatriate refugees to Syria, which is a popular cause among the Lebanese.188 Russian companies have also moved into offshore gas exploration, building on similar agreements to those with Syria.189
One longstanding Russian goal is to build a relationship with the Lebanese military, which Moscow sees as both a conduit for political influence and, if Gulf economic aid foots the bill, a potential customer.190 Western pressure on the Lebanese military has so far limited the Kremlin’s advances. After much stalling, the Lebanese military reportedly rejected a donation of free

ammunition from Russia in 2018, for which Moscow blamed US interference.191 Later reports indicated that the gift might instead be accepted by an internal security body linked to Hariri, who seeks Moscow’s favor to manage his difficult relationship with Damascus and Hezbollah.192
The Authoritarian Advantage
Most Western leaders have come to view Vladimir Putin as a maddeningly unreliable and frustrating figure, but some of the rulers in the Middle East appear to see his regime in a different light. It is probably less of a chore for an authoritarian king or president to deal with Russia than with democratic nations in Europe or the United States, where decision-making is constrained by nosy journalists, volatile public debate, and an explicit (even if insincere) commitment to liberal values. Putin is a ruler much more in their own mold: he takes a transactional approach to politics, has no ambition to spread democracy (or any other ideology) and can settle deals with a handshake without waiting for parliament to agree. In short, in the world’s least democratic region, Russia enjoys an authoritarian advantage.
Russian diplomats take every chance they can get to highlight their policy of noninterference in domestic affairs, sometimes even inserting themselves into human rights-related disputes that Russia is not a

party to. For example, when Saudi Arabia grew irritated by Canadian criticism of the 2018 jailing of high-profile female dissidents, a Russian spokesperson lashed out at the Canadians and asserted that Riyadh “has the sovereign right to decide how to move forward.”193 More recently, when the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 put a strain on the US-Saudi Arabian relationship, Putin breezily dismissed the scandal and greeted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with a grinning high-five at a G-20 meeting.194
Similarly, when the United States temporarily froze arms sales to Egypt in response to Sisi’s 2013 military coup and subsequent repression, Putin immediately conveyed an offer of Russian weapons instead.195 In 2017, Russian arms sales to Egypt vastly outstripped those of the United States for the first time since the 1970s.196
Russia has long made a point of ignoring Western injunctions about the need to isolate “rogue states,” pointing out, with some merit, that the United States takes a rather different attitude to its own undemocratic allies. However, the Kremlin now appears to be intensifying its cultivation of authoritarians ostracized by the United States. Such governments are generally eager to strike up a relationship

with Russia, and many have been impressed by the Kremlin’s ruthless defense of its ally in Syria.
Sudan is a case in point. There has been a warrant for the arrest of its president, Omar al-Bashir, since 2009 for trial in the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide. In 2017, however, Bashir was hosted in Moscow, where he praised Putin for standing up against hostile US practices and proposed the establishment of a Russian naval supply depot on Sudan’s Red Sea coast.197
The idea of a Russian Red Sea base came up again in a 2019 Sputnik News interview with Maj. Gen. al-Hadi Adam, the head of the Sudanese Parliament’s Defense and Security Committee. At the time, Sudan was experiencing growing street protests against Bashir’s rule and Adam seemed to have recent history on his mind: “Every state needs an ally and the strategic ally, you might say, is the one who is a friend in times of need, when others abandon you.” Adam added that “we’re seeing this now, for example, in the strategic relationship between Russia and Syria.”198

Who Runs Russian Middle East Policy?
Russia’s face to the world, its Foreign Ministry, is viewed by most Middle East watchers as politically abrasive but competent and well trained. Some Russian diplomats appear to have impressive knowledge of Arabic.199
Western diplomats describe Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s Foreign Minister since 2004, as a skilled and highly experienced professional with an outstanding memory for detail and a capacity to argue even the most absurd points with a straight face.200
Middle East diplomacy is overseen by one of Lavrov’s deputies, Mikhail Bogdanov. Bogdanov is an Arabic speaker with a PhD in Russian-Egyptian relations who doubles as Putin’s personal Middle East and North Africa envoy. Bogdanov, too, receives high marks from Western diplomats.201
While Bogdanov is the only deputy foreign minister specifically assigned to the Middle East, some of his nine colleagues hold related portfolios. Sergei Ryabkov handles US affairs but is also in charge of the Iranian nuclear file. The former Federal Security Service (FSB) counterintelligence chief, Oleg Syromolotov, holds the antiterrorism portfolio.202 In March 2018, the former head

One person interviewed in Lebanon in 2015 expressed surprise at how fluently his Russian interlocutors conversed and even took notes in Arabic. Others felt spied-on by diplomats who seemed to know more than they let on: “They seem to know Arabic. They don’t say anything, but sometimes you can tell from their body language that they understand,” noted a Syrian interviewed in Turkey in 2018. 200

of the ministry’s Middle East desk, Sergei Vershinin, another Arabic speaker, was also raised to the rank of deputy foreign minister, reportedly sidelining Bogdanov to some extent. Vershinin has played a key role in overseeing diplomacy on Syria.203
Despite this impressive pool of talent, the Foreign Ministry “is not a decision-making structure,” cautions Nikolay Kozhanov, a former Russian diplomat and a Middle East expert:
It is basically a kind of postal service, receiving incoming messages from other countries and sending the messages they’re asked to deliver. As for the decision-making structures, that depends on the issue. It might be the Security Council of the Russian Federation or a certain group of people within the Security Council. Some issues may be handled by the Presidency or by certain people in the Presidency, or indeed by the president himself.204
The Security Council is a consultative body appointed and chaired by the president, tasked with overall strategic planning.205 Its core group of 12 members comprises the cabinet ministers with foreign or security portfolios, the heads of intelligence, and other key officials. It is notable for the absence of, for example, economic specialists. Putin’s successor as FSB chief, Nikolay Patrushev, has served as secretary

of the Security Council since 2008 but the council’s influence has grown in recent years, since “just about every sphere of Russian policy making” has come to be viewed as a national security matter.206
The outsized role that national security officials play in Russian policymaking creates its own structural biases, according to Yury Barmin who says that senior military and intelligence figures seem to prioritize ideological and military-strategic goals over sustainable economic choices. He noted that many senior officials have been suspicious of Saudi Arabia since the Chechen wars, and appear to have pushed back against Russian attempts to deepen ties with the Gulf: “Of course, the diplomats are more open-minded but when it comes to the Middle East, the diplomats do not play the leading role: it’s the security elites.” Barmin added: “A lot of them still think the [Gulf] is an American playground.”207
Since the 2015 intervention, the Defense Ministry has by and large led policy development in Syria alongside the Presidency. The Russian military headquarters at Hmeymim has completely overshadowed the role of the Russian Embassy in Damascus.208 On diplomatic matters, however, Vershinin runs the show alongside the presidential Syria envoy, Alexander Lavrentiev.209

Ultimately, the president controls all major foreign policy decisions, to the extent that policymaking “comes to a standstill when Vladimir Putin is absent.”210 Putin is nonetheless known to consult an inner circle, which also appears to be heavily dominated by national security figures cut from same cloth as the president. For example, Putin has said he ordered the invasion of Crimea in 2014 after discussions with Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and three other senior officials, all of whom are old KGB hands from his St Petersburg days: Presidential Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov, Nikolay Patrushev of the Security Council, and FSB chief Alexander Bortnikov.211 Highstakes decisions on the Middle East, such as the 2015 Syria intervention, were presumably made in a similar setting.212
Kadyrov: Proxy or Freelancer?
A peculiar element of Russia’s role in the Middle East is the personal diplomacy of the President of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. Styling himself a benefactor of Sunni Islam and a proponent of Sufism against Salafi teachings, Kadyrov has, to Moscow’s dismay, ordered the imposition of some elements of sharia law in Chechnya.213 His eccentric strongman rule at home has been matched by an energetic political and
212 A Security Council meeting that dealt with Syria policy in
December 2018 was, according to the state-owned TASS news agency, attended by President Vladimir Putin, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, the speakers of both parliamentary chambers, Valentina Matviyenko and Vyacheslav Volodin, Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, FSB Director Alexander Bortnikov, SVR Director Sergei Naryshkin, and Special Presidential Representative for Nature Protection, Ecology, and Transport Issues Sergei Ivanov. “Putin, Security Council discuss Syrian settlement – Kremlin,” TASS, December 28, 2018, http://tass.com/politics/1038369. 213 Fred Weir, “Kremlin frets as Russia’s once restive Islamist region takes up political Islam,” Christian Science Monitor, September 20, 2017, https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2017/0920/Kremlinfrets-as-Russia-s-once-restive-Islamist-region-takes-up-politicalIslam.

religious activism abroad. In particular, Kadyrov has built relationships with several Gulf royals, holding personal meetings with the powerful crown princes of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and the Emir of Qatar.214
One facet of Kadyrov’s activism is related to security matters. For example, he has supplied Chechnyan troops for Russia’s intervention in Syria. Commercial military services have also been offered to governments in the Gulf.215 Kadyrov engages in religious diplomacy, humanitarian projects, and other soft power exercises as part of a broader outreach that seems designed to project him as a patron of Sufi-inspired Sunni Islam.216 In Syria, for example, the Chechen government has funded high-profile projects to restore Aleppo’s Great Mosque and the Khaled Ibn al-Walid Mosque in Homs.217
The extent to which Kadyrov operates on behalf of the Kremlin remains somewhat unclear. Although the Putin-Kadyrov relationship is indisputably one of patron and client, the Chechen leader seems to be acting autonomously and it is not always clear who is using whom. Kadyrov does not travel abroad as Moscow’s formal envoy,

but he is nonetheless received as a visiting dignitary and invited to talk about bilateral relations with Russia. He has also been known to bring Russian officials and businesspeople to meet the Gulf royals.
However, there is occasionally friction with the Kremlin, especially in relation to Kadyrov’s loose-cannon religious activism. In August 2016, Kadyrov convened a theological conference for traditionalist and non-Salafi Sunnis in Grozny. Among the attendees were senior state-appointed Sunni clerics from Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, as well as Sufi figures with links to the United Arab Emirates and other antiIslamist Arab governments.218 To the horror of some attendees, Kadyrov concluded the meeting by announcing that it had approved a statement excommunicating Salafism from the fold of Sunni Islam.219 Kadyrov’s “conference fatwa” triggered an outraged backlash against Russia from the powerful Salafi clergy in Saudi Arabia, and some conference-goers found the situation so embarrassing that they publicly disassociated themselves from the event.220 Kadyrov was forced to tour the Gulf to patch up relations, explaining that he was

not against “true” Salafis, just the bad kind.221
A year later, Kadyrov again drew Moscow’s ire by defiantly staging large demonstrations in Grozny to protest against Russia’s support for the government of Myanmar, which stands accused of massacring Rohingya Muslims.222
The Wagner Phenomenon
There has been a growing role for Russian security contractors, or mercenaries, in conflict zones in recent years. This is a murky and poorly regulated market.223 The most prominent company involved is the Wagner Group, which first gained attention in Ukraine. In Syria, Wagner contractors are thought to account for a large proportion of all Russian casualties.224 Formed in 2013, and reportedly controlled by businessman Yevgeni Prigozhin, a Putin ally who has ties with the Russian military, Wagner received considerable backing from the Defense Ministry for its activities in Syria after 2015. At its peak in 2016, the company reportedly deployed “equipment and manpower equivalent to an infantry regiment, with access to tanks, rocket

artillery, howitzers, and air support, from the Russian Ministry of Defence.”225
Since 2016, Wagner’s operations in Syria appear to have slowed down. The company’s activities at the time were said to be financed by deals between Prigozhinlinked companies and the Syrian government.226 In December 2017, the AP news agency published what appeared to be a contract between Evro Polis, a company owned by Prigozhin, and a stateowned Syrian oil firm. According to this document, the authenticity of which AP could not confirm, Evro Polis would receive a 25 percent share of the proceeds from any oil or gas fields recaptured on behalf of Damascus.227 Unsurprisingly, Wagner has been accused of serving as a front for the GRU but others see it as a commercial enterprise with strong links to the national security environment, created to win favor with the Kremlin.228 The line is certainly blurred, and one does not exclude the other.229
In February 2018, US forces claimed to have killed 200–300 personnel attacking US allies in eastern Syria, in violation of a deconfliction line negotiated by American

and Russian officers.230 Casualty estimates varied, but most of the attackers were said to have been Wagner employees, including an indeterminate number of Russian nationals. The Russian government reacted in an uncharacteristically subdued fashion, unwilling to either accept responsibility for the raid or counter-escalate in response. Much remains unclear about the incident.
Conclusions: Strategy or Improvisation?
Few analysts appear to believe that Russia is pursuing a clear strategy in the Middle East, beyond being guided by certain interests, such as energy cooperation, counterterrorism, and trade; and fears, such as of political upheaval, US influence, and Sunni Islamism. Within these parameters, the Kremlin’s current role in the Middle East appears to have been improvised step by step, evolving along a path-dependent trajectory in response to changing domestic and international constraints. The surge in Russian involvement in the region “came about almost by chance,” according to Trenin:
Had there been no Arab Spring and had there been no need to show Russia’s resolve, Russia’s muscle, and Russia’s ability to nix some US policies in the Middle East, then maybe Russia would have taken a much less energetic approach to the

Interview, Trenin. 232
As Andrew Moneghan notes, “assertions of a Russian ‘master plan’ often simply amount to joining up some dots of various externally visible activities and deducing that they are driven by a strategic agenda – regardless of the inherent

region. But the confluence of those facts resulted in what we saw started in 2015.231
Assumptions that Russia must have some form of master plan for the Middle East smack of overthinking. It is a fact that Western nations have also largely improvised their responses to events since 2011, and why would Russia be any different? In any event, it is hard to imagine what sort of plan could productively have guided Moscow through the chaos of recent years.232
“I think the idea of Moscow having a strategy is derived from the fact that a lot of Western countries, including the United States and the EU, do not have such a strategy”, said Russian foreign policy expert Maxim Suchkov. “When they look at what Moscow is doing it appears rather successful – so there should be some strategy behind it.” He added that he did not necessarily view the absence of a Russian strategy as a negative factor: “On the merits, the Middle East is so complicated and turbulent that it really is hard to think several years ahead.”233
But the absence of an explicit Russian plan or formula for the Middle East does not mean that Russian diplomacy operates in a vacuum or at random. On the contrary, Russia appears to be carving out a highly specific niche in the Middle East’s political environment: that of a self-interested and pragmatic status quo power.234 It is strategic entrenchment by praxis, rather than plan or doctrine, but, in so far as it is established
difficulties of strategy-making and any Russian internal complexities.” Moneghan 2017, p. 5. 233
Interview, Suchkov. 234
According to Hanna Notte, “The way Russia portrays its Middle East policy – or its Syria policy for that matter – is as that of the conservative, responsible global power that protects minorities in the Middle East and advocates for a truly multipolar world, standing against Western unilateralism and regime change policies that force the West’s understanding of democratization or of social and political change on the region.” Interview, Notte.

and recognized, it may nonetheless add some future consistency to a Russian Middle East policy that has until now been characterized by constant evolution and opportunistic improvisation.
Despite the undeniable reputational costs and heightened tensions with the United States, Russia’s post-2011 engagement with the Middle East has brought net benefits: enhanced global prestige, greater regional influence, some new economic investment, and added leverage over Western adversaries. As currently configured, the

country’s role in the region appears both effective and sustainable.
That said, serious questions remain about Russia’s structural and economic health, and about Putin’s approach to foreign policy. If the Kremlin’s spiraling ambition – and the inevitable Western pushback – end up creating resource-draining commitments elsewhere, or inspire Russian overreach in the region, or force a retreat to Soviet-style partisanship, Moscow’s investment in the Middle East could once again turn from asset to liability.


Research in the field of innovation is very important, because innovations are necessary prerequisites for the success of companies. Innovation management has to be executed in consideration of external influences (environment) and internal influences (company). The research topic is about optimizing the budget allocation for innovation management. The main research question is how to decide between the two basic options: exploitation and exploration. A promising way is to balance these two antipodes. One extent is to do research and development to explore new knowledge and create basic innovations as well as to use new technologies to invent new products (exploration). The other extent is to fully utilize and exploit existing possibilities, potential, and technologies (exploitation). It is a crucial management task to find the right balance between these two proceedings. To answer the research question is how to balance exploration and exploitation in an adequate way. The applied method is literature research and analytical development of a tool, which should help to find the right management decision about innovation strategy and budget allocation. This article is a conceptual paper with a deductive approach, in which the framework of variables influencing the decision about exploration and exploitation is introduced and in which the Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio (IAP) as a tool to substantiate the decision between the two antipodes is presented. As a result, the specific contribution to academic discussion, based on critical literature review, is twofold: firstly, deployment of a systematic framework of antecendents and tradeoffs influencing the management decision. Secondly, the development and introduction of the Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio. The structure of the paper consists of three main parts. The first part is about the introduction and problem formulation. In the second part, a critical literature review is done and leads to the research results, which are summarized in the framework of innovation management. Factors of influence are analyzed and discussed. In the third part, the Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio is introduced as a tool to balance exploration and exploitation. The conclusion of this paper is that decisions about innovation strategies can be made in a more differentiated way by using the Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio.
Keywords: antecendents, exploration, exploitation, innovation, Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio

BALANCE EXPLOITATION AND EXPLORATION OF INNOVATIONS

Introduction and Problem Formulation
Innovations are the engine of economic prosperity and wealth. Innovations require permanent effort for renewal, they are essential for success and competitiveness (Hofbauer, Körner, Nikolaus, & Poost 2009). Being innovative means to be able to modernize the product portfolio and to adapt products to changing demand (Gandhi & Hofbauer, 2016). In order to put these issues into execution, it is inevitable to analyze and recognize the signals from the environment and to transfer this information into appropriate managerial actions. In this context especially referring to exploration and exploitation of innovation. Figure 1 shows the dimensions, which have to be analyzed.

The scope of this article is to do critical research on existing literature about exploration and exploitation of innovation. The crucial research question is how to stimulate and promote the evolvement of exploration and exploitation in an adequate constellation. Based on the literature review, the framework of antecedents, tradeoffs, and outcome of innovation management will be explained. After that, the Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio as a supporting tool to balance exploration and exploitation in the best possible way will be introduced.
Literature Review About Exploration and Exploitation of Innovations
Exploration and exploitation belong to the fundamental terms of strategic knowledge management, which become more and more important for economic management as well as for innovation and product management (Hofbauer & Sangl, 2011). A brief description shows the difference: “exploration as refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation, and execution, contrasting it with exploitation, which

BALANCE EXPLOITATION AND EXPLORATION OF INNOVATIONS

419

involves search, variation, risk-taking, experimentation, play, flexibility, discovery, and innovation” (Lavie, Stettner, & Tushman, 2010).
Exploration of Innovations Companies need new products to operate successfully in the market. Therefore, they have to explore new
potentials through new technologies (Hofbauer, 2013). By turning away from the existing knowledge, they create new knowledge and develop new capabilities in order to detect new chances and to develop previously unknown potentials. By doing this, companies are prepared to react to changing demand or even create new trends (Auh & Menguc, 2005). Exploration is future-oriented and has a long term horizon, providing high potentials, but is also linked with high risk. Know how is designed in a botton-up learning process independently from existing knowledge and technology (Lubatkin, Simsek, Ling, & Veiga 2006).
Exploitation of Innovations By using exploitative proceedings, companies endeavor to use existing capabilities and technologies. This
means to exploit available knowledge and existing technologies, know how, or networks (March, 1991). This will be possible by doing improvement, specialisation, selection, refinement, and experience. The adaptation to new constellations will be done by stepwise improvement (Gupta, Smith, & Shalley 2006). Compared to exploration, the proceeding of exploration is oriented towards the past, because accumulated knowledge is used without reflection towards the future. Correspondingly, exploitative innovations have a short term horizon with low risk, but accordingly limited chances. Exploitation is executed in directed processes of search. In addition to that, companies tend to perpetuate practiced procedures and to institutionalize processes, which are adapted in an optimal way to existing competences. This procedure is well known as top-down learning process (Lubatkin et al., 2006).

As mentioned above, the basic research method is critical literature review. As a result, there are some characteristics of differentiation, which help for a better understanding and distinction. Research results are summarized in Table 1 as typical characteristics of exploration and exploitation. The differences are illustrated by typical features distinguished by the means of the strategic management.

BALANCE EXPLOITATION AND EXPLORATION OF INNOVATIONS

The Mutual Relationship of Exploration and Exploitation
Another result of critical literature review is summarized in this section. In the subsequent remarks, the mutual relationship of the different proceedings will be focused. Tradeoffs, balancing, and ambidexterity are explained.
Tradeoff Between Exploration and Exploitation There is an interrelation between explorative and exploitative proceedings (Gupta et al., 2006). The
tradeoff relation between “Resource Exploration” and “Resource Exploitation” is in the focus of research since many years. In face of given differences, it is not easy to make a clear distinction and to give clear advice for one of the two proceedings (Lavie et al., 2010).
There is a crowding out between the two proceedings, because both need capacities and resources as well as management attention. Both approaches are competing for budgets. The budget allocated for exploration is not available for exploitation and vice versa.
There are two kinds of crowding out. On the one side, there is the Failure Trap, where exploration crowds out exploitation. This means that the explorative search is risky and causes possibly new failures. On the other side, there is the Success Trap, where exploitation crowds out exploration. Compared to the results of exploration, this procedure is more promising in the short term horizon.
Balancing Exploration and Exploitation The long term oriented effectivity of exploration as well as the short term oriented efficiency of
exploitation is essential for the sustainable success of a company. A one sided emphasis of the activity removes the possibilities of the other activity. For example, it is very risky to emphasize exploration and generate too less specific competencies or too much underdeveloped ideas. On the other side, a concentration on exploitation bears the danger to keep hold of too many outdated capabilities and resources. This could lead to short term success, but it would be at the expense of adaptability and competitiveness (Lavie & Rosenkopf, 2006).
The mutual relationship has to be optimized that the internal resources can be allocated in the best way. The approach to solving this problem is to use both proceedings simultaneously by balancing benefits and disadvantages. Chen and Katila (2008) postulated: “some degree of balance is necessary for firm‘s survival and success”.
Thus, one can derive that a positive interrelation can be very promising for the success of a company. This kind of relationship is called ambidexterity and means balancing the positive results.
Ambidexterity Ambidexterity is an established term in the context of using exploration and exploitation to a certain extent
(Lubatkin et al., 2006). This means that existing resources are used simultaneously subdivided for the different tasks (resource exploitation) to create the highest value (alignment) (O’Reilly & Tushman, 2004). Therefore, there is a need for a strong efficiency orientation to develop new resources (resource exploration) to be able to adapt to changes of the environment (adaptability). This requires a high flexibility to use “diverging logics” or “competing frames” (Proff & Haberle, 2010).
There are a lot of comprehensible reasons to balance exploration and exploitation in order to foster innovation activities (Wollersheim, 2010). In this respect, each innovating company faces the challenge to find

BALANCE EXPLOITATION AND EXPLORATION OF INNOVATIONS

421

the right proportion for innovation with exploration and exploitation. The determining variables to balance in an adequate way can only be derived from a professional screening of the environment matched with the characteristics of the examined company (Hofbauer & Bergmann, 2013). The question is whether there is a need to radically innovate, or is it sufficient to innovate incrementally.
Radical or Incremental Innovation
Figure 2 shows the results (output) of the combinations of technologies and markets (Fischer & Lange, 2002; Hofbauer & Sangl, 2011). Radical innovations result from explorative proceeding on the basis of pacemaking technologies targeting completely new markets. This leads ot completely new solutions for given problems (basic or fundamental innovation). Incremental innovations follow exploitative proceeding, in this case, existing solutions are developed further and improved step by step (improved innovation).

Framework of Innovation Management
The analysis and discussion of scientific literature shows a variety of influencing factors on innovation management. Figure 3 displays the factors having influence on innovation management (Lavie et al., 2010). The part of the antecendents contains all influencing factors of the environment (external) and the company (internal). The findings of the analysis of the external and internal prerequisites affect the tradeoffs and the tendency towards exploration or exploitation. A substantial impact comes from the dynamism of the environment in terms of structural interruption and competitive pressure. For making the right decision, it is essential to identify the predictors of dynamism in time. Further factors like organization and management have an impact on the arrangement and balancing of innovation activities, too.
According to the input and management decision, a short or long term output will be visible in Figure 3.

422

BALANCE EXPLOITATION AND EXPLORATION OF INNOVATIONS

Figure 3. Factors of influence on innovation management with exploration and exploitation. Source: own graph, modified according to Lavie et al. (2010).
From the scientific point of view, two factors of influence can be identified:  Company (organization and management)  Environment (market and technology)
The analysis of these two dimensions establishes the understanding of the context and supports the decision making in the field of exploration and exploitation. Changes, ruptures, and crashes should be detected in time and consequences for the company should be identified. In doing this in a proper way, the management will get the right input for the strategic orientation in the very early phase of the product management (Hofbauer & Bergmann, 2012). These changes may be caused by customer needs, new technologies, or changing demand.
Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio
In this chapter, the Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio (IAP) as a tool to support the decision towards exploration or exploitation in a comprehensible and balanced way will be introduced. As explained above, the essential dimensions of influence are company (internal) and environment (external). These two dimensions are the two axis, which build up the portfolio. The dimensions may be subdivided in various subdimensions, which represent the contemporary set of influencing factors.
Figure 4 shows the IAP exemplified with specific subdimensions. Depending on the results of the analysis, the company achieves one of the given categories (low-medium-high). Combining the categories for both dimensions, the company under review obtains a combination within the different quadrants. This position enables to derive strategies like exploration, selection, or exploitation. In case of selection, there is further research inevitable.

Conclusion
Innovations ensure competitiveness, profitability, and survival of companies. Innovations are inevitable to protect and upgrade competitiveness. Rising dynamism of markets, increasing price pressure, intensification of global competition, hybrid forms of customer needs, and accumulated complexity of products are prevailing challenges for companies. To execute innovation management means a continuous decision process between exploration and exploitation.
The value added of this article is to introduce a tool in terms of the Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio (IAP), which helps to find a systematic way of balancing innovation activities. A systematic research about the framework of a company is necessary for a contemporary analysis of antecendents. This input provides magnitude and direction for the early phase “strategic orientation” of the product management cycle (Hofbauer & Sangl, 2011) and gives by trend an indication for the proportion between exploration and exploitation. A permanent and consistent analysis of external (environment) and internal (company) factors is a crucial prerequisite for appropriate management decisions.
In this article, the Innovation-Alignment-Portfolio is introduced. It is a well-structured tool, which is based on an integrated and contemporary framework.

The fact that the global crisis did not affect Islamic banks impressed all financial institutions and providers around the world; the fast growth and expansion in less than one century since it was first established in 1963 in Egypt. Many studies and researches discussed in theoretically the used principles and instruments in Islamic banks to achieve financial stability under any financial situation. However, this study will test the growth of Islamic banks and conventional banks after the crisis in both categories (asset and profitability) between United Arab Bank (UAB)1 and Sharjah Islamic bank (SIB)2. In addition, the study found that Islamic banking system is more efficient and stable against any hard, sudden financial situation, and is less risky even though the growth is more likely steady. Also, it found that conventional banks are more profitable but less financially stable and more risky.
Keywords: Islamic banks, conventional banks, accounting, finance, financial statements
Introduction
The huge expansion of Islamic banks around the world in Muslim and Non-Muslim countries attracted the attention of every financial institution, only by looking at the young age of Islamic banks in the financial market. In addition, the fact that Islamic banks were less or not affected by the 2007-2008 financial crisis attracted many Non-Muslim customers in foreign countries. Many researchers made studies, books, and theories about Islamic banks revealing the differences of the principles, financial instruments, and system, which are different from Islamic banks to conventional banks.
Both Islamic banks and conventional banks in general give the same financial services to customers and business, but the ways or instruments that the financial services are functioned in the both banks are different.
This research will discuss some differences between Islamic banks and conventional banks in the form of case study between one Islamic bank (Sharjah Islamic Bank) and one conventional bank (United Arab Bank) in UAE. It did a comparison between them, the growth of each bank in both profit and asset.

426 IMPACT OF ISLAMIC BANKS GROWTH ON CONVENTIONAL BANKS DEVELOPMENT
Research Objectives The main objective of this study is to measure the effect of Islamic banks’ growth on the growth of

What Is the Definition of Islamic Banking?
Islamic banking refers to a system of banking activity, which is consisting with the principles of Islamic rulings (Shari’ah). You can see the practical application of these principles through the development of Islamic economies, these principles clearly have emphasis on the ethical values and morality in all dealings that have a huge appeal either socially or financially.
The Islamic rulings prohibit the acceptance and payment of interest in any type of transactions either lending (loans) or acceptance (deposits) of money, goods, and services, which is known in Islam as Riba3. The Islamic banks appeared in the late 20th century in Islamic countries to provide an alternative to the Muslims, instead of the conventional banks that accept and deal with interest charges, which is against the Shari’ah in Islam, although Islamic banking services are not restricted to Muslims only.
The actual process way to obtain the actual Shari’ah is the Qur’an as well as the actual saved sayings and steps involving Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)—the actual Hadith. Wherever methods to problems are not seen in these places, rulings are manufactured based on the comprehensive agreement of the local community leaned historians, unbiased thought of an Islamic college student and custom made, providing that like rulings to never deviate through the simple theories inside Qur’an. This is one of the characteristics of the Islamic banking against the long history of conventional banks.
What Is the Definition of Conventional Banking?
Classification connected with “commercial bank” as well as “conventional bank”: bank. Bank is usually a financial institution to provide solutions or services, such as accepting deposits, home loan credit, giving business loans and car loans, and basic investment products like certificates of deposit and savings accounts .
The original professional financial institution is usually a offline association together with tellers, safe and sound deposit boxes, vaults, as well as ATMs. Nevertheless, many professional finance institutions will not have almost any bodily branches as well as call for shoppers to finish almost all orders by means of telephone as well as Net (technology services). In trade, they generally spend higher interest levels on ventures as well as remains, as well as demand decreases expenses, which is often a pattern within the last three years.
How Are Islamic Banks Different From Conventional Banks?
Islamic bank has the very same goal seeing that standard bank apart from it performs relative to the guidelines associated with Shari’ah unlike standard financial institutions, which is usually referred to as Fiqh al-Muamalat (Islamic regulations with transactions) which usually described inside simple words and phrases “sharing income and also loss” and also prohibiting gathering or providing “interest, fees, expenses, and so on”. However, the things Islamic bank need to do are that they should be often employed in line with this Shari’ah
3 Riba: is an Arabic term mentioned in the Holy Quran, literally, “increase”, “addition”, or “growth”. Technically, it refers to the “premium” that must be paid by the borrower to the lender along with the principal amount as a condition for the loan or an extension in its maturity. Interest as commonly under stood today, is regarded by predominant majority of “fuqaha” to be equivalent to Riba (profit).

and its particular practical application with the progress associated with Islamic economics. Many of the guidelines inside Islamic bank are centered and also normally recognized around the globe, for hundreds of years rather than generations. These kinds of guidelines will not be new nevertheless debatably, Muslim scientist has modified their particular initial talk about above the generations.
This process source of the particular Shari’ah may be the Qur’an and then the particular recorded sayings as well as actions of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)—the particular Hadith. Wherever solutions to problems are not within the two of these solutions, rulings are created using the comprehensive agreement of your neighborhood leaned students, impartial reasons of the Islamic college student as well as custom, provided that these kinds of rulings never deviate on the basic theories in the Qur’an.
Table 1 will show the difference between Islamic banking and conventional banking.

Table 1

The Difference Between Islamic Banking and Conventional Banking

Islamic banking

Conventional banking

In Islamic banking, money is not considered as a commodity. However, it is considered as a medium of exchange and a way to store value. Therefore, it will not be sold to the customer at a price higher than the real value of the money (face value).
After trading on goods or providing services, the profit that is collected is the basis of earning profit in Islamic banks.
The share of profit and loss is one of the Islamic banking principles.
Making agreements is necessary for exchanging of goods and services.
Islamic banking tends to create link with the real sectors of the economic system by using trade related activities. Since, the money is linked with the real assets therefore it contributes directly in the economic development.

In Conventional, banking it is the opposite money is a commodity and a medium of exchange. In addition, it can be sold at a higher price than its real vale (face value) which leads to inflation.
The basis of charging an interest on the money or capital is the time value. That is how conventional banks earn profit.
If the customer or organization is suffering from a loss, the charges are going to be charged on the customer no matter what.
Agreements are not made in distributing of cash finance or working capital finance, for exchanging goods and services.
Conventional banking tends to be the third party in every deal, which only lend money and charge interest, selling money for money, without creating any link in the real sectors.

What Principles Each Bank Follows?
Theoretical Basis for Islamic Banking Some people believe that Islamic banks are financial structure with interest-free system, but the truth is
that Islamic banks are a complete system of justices both in economic and social fields. One of the basic principles in Islamic banking is that the bank deals with the incentive system, the
allocation of resources in the economy, the economic freedom and decision-making freedom, and the emphasis of the proper role of the government.
Theoretical Basis for Conventional Banking Conventional banking is a system based on interest-bearing debt (Hossein, 2012). And income comes
from commission, fees, and net interest (which they calculated by finding the difference from ending and the interest cost on deposit).

Profitability
The following indicators measure profitability:  ROA (Return on Asset): which means how much the bank gain against each one AED.  ROE (Return on Equity): which shows the amount the owners get against each one AED they invest in the bank.
According to Table 4, ROA decreased by 23.37%, the profit increased by 7.2% unlike the asset growth with 39.9% and with profit margin that was weak in 2011 at 49.21%.
In the next year 2012, ROA decreased to 2.26%. The decreased amount was 14.1%, with increased profit and asset (24.1%, 44.2%), the ROA keeps decreasing with 2.29% in 2013. Moreover, in 2014 also, a decrease in ROA from 2.56% in 2013 to 2.35% in the last year can be seen. With light increase in the profit 9.58%, and increase in the asset with 19.3%, these caused the ROA to decrease in the last five years. The increased total operating expenses over the past five years might helped the ROA to decrease. Moreover, the net profit margin also decreased except in 2013 it increased to reach 45.60% and decreased in the next year.
The increased operational expenses with 26.02% in 2014, caused decrease in the net profit margin 37.89% in the last year, these two factors caused a decline in the ROA at that year.

Figure 1 shows the trend of changes in both ROE and ROA during the period 2010-2014. As for the ROE, it keeps fluctuating between increasing and decreasing from 2010 to 2014. In the period from 2010 to 2011, It showed a decrease with 2.46%, with low increase in the profit 7.2% and increase in equity with 9.9%, which

caused a decrease in ROE at these two years. Nevertheless, in 2012, an increase with 12.12% can be seen, because of the increase in profit with 24.1% and light increase in the equity 10.7%, which led to increased ROE at that year.
The same thing goes in 2013 with increase in the profit 34.81%, and light increase in equity 10.4%, that helped the ROE increase to achieve 22.12% in 2013.
However, in 2014, the equity increased with 17.33%, and with profit at 9.58%; the ROE decreased by 6.60%. The increase in the loans and advances with 17.37%, and the provision for credit loses 122.05% in 2014 in the balance sheet might helped to decrease the ROE and also the net income.

It can be seen from Figure 2 and Table 7 that the ROE decreased by 8.5% in 2011, and was 5.60%. Because the profit decreased by 5.74%, but the equity increased by 6.40% from 2010 to 2011.
However, in 2012 the profit increased to 8.32% and the equity increased by 3.29%. In 2013, the equity increased to 18.63% but the profit increased with 12.89%, which caused the increase in the ROE that year. However, in 2014, a light recover is noticeable by increase reached 19.7% in equity against the profit increased to 22.83%. This big increase in the ROE might happen because the bank decided to increase the dividend payout ratio to 64%. In addition, the increase in provision-net of recoveries with 142.54% in the last year might helped ROE to rise.
As for ROA, in 2010 the base year it started with 1.59%. However, in the next year, the asset raised with 6.4%, with a negative decrease in the profit (5.74%) and light increase in the asset, the ROA increased to accomplish 1.41% in 2011.
Nevertheless, the indicator improved in 2012 for increase in the asset and profit, respectively with 3.29% and 8.32%, which led to increase in the ROA by 8.39%.
From 2012 to 2013, the ROA decreased to 4.73%, because the asset increased rapidly from 3.29% to 18.65%. However, in the last year 2014, the asset increased to 19.7%, but the profit raised with 22.83%, which led to an increased ROA in the last year. The ROA fluctuated with the same rate, as the fluctuating net profit margin from 2010 to 2014 as the schedule above shows.

436 IMPACT OF ISLAMIC BANKS GROWTH ON CONVENTIONAL BANKS DEVELOPMENT
Which Bank Got the Highest Percent of Growth on Assets and Profitability?
In the comparison between these two banks, each one of them achieved a growth at some point in the last five years, but the result found that the Islamic banks are more efficiency in its operations and less riskier, even though their growth is steady. However, the conventional banks are more fluctuating in one year they get a high growth rate but at the sane time have a decrease in the growth rates.
The study has compared the two main profitability factors ROA and ROE over the period of five years from 2010-2014 and entailed that the return on asset and equity is more stable in the Islamic bank but in the conventional bank the fluctuation is more, and that because growth in asset was not steady and the growth in equity wasn’t in proportion of growth in asset, which leads to fluctuation in ROE. But in the Islamic bank, the growth in asset in proportion with growth in equity results to an increase in equity multiplier and eventually increases in ROE even if there was a decrease in ROA.
Therefore, over that period, the Islamic bank had 34% growth on return on equity and 56% growth on asset while the conventional bank had only 24.7% growth in return on equity and 232% growth in asset. Which means that Islamic bank needed less growth in asset to increase its return by higher percentage than the conventional bank. Growth of Islamic bank asset was less than the quarter of growth in conventional bank asset but it gave a higher growth in return.
In the last two years, it has been found that the EPS are increasing in Sharjah Islamic Bank, but it decreased in United Arab Bank, even thought UAB Bank gives more EPS. However, it is much safer for the customers to invest in SIB Bank due to the financial stability and steady growth, more EPS means more profit, but more profit also means more risk. In addition, it has been noticed that both the ROA and ROE decreased in United Arab Bank, but increased in Sharjah Islamic Bank. However, the NPM decreased in 2014 in both banks but in SIB, the decrease was very light, unlike UAB that decreased from 45.60% in 2013 to 37.895 in 2014.
It also proves that Islamic banks are more profitable, financially stable, and less risky. All that is because the Shari’ah principle the Islamic Banks follows unlike the conventional banks, which are more risky and less stable.
What Are the Reasons for the Growth?
Many reasons helped the banks that are studying to reach higher growth rate after the crisis:  Lenders recover from the 2007-2008 worldwide credit card debt.  The increase of government’s spending on national infrastructure, rebounding within trade and tourism.  Dubai’s Expo 2020 wins helped the country’s upgrade to emerging markets around the globe.  Low interest levels incurred about financial loans.  Stable returns, dividends in spite of an increasing capital base.  The highest deposit-to-loan proportions.  Stable entry to long-term funding and decreasing funding fees or costs.
All these reasons and more have helped to boost business confidence and activity.
Will This Trend Continue in the Future?
According to the result got from this research, the Islamic banks will continue with their stable expansion in the future with more loyal customers, profitability, and asset growth despite the fact that both banks face a good growth rate.

IMPACT OF ISLAMIC BANKS GROWTH ON CONVENTIONAL BANKS DEVELOPMENT 437
Conclusions
This research studied the growth of Islamic banks and conventional banks, during five years after 2007-2008 financial crises from 2010 to 2014. The author introduced the study first by a comparison between Islamic and conventional banks in terms of the definition, basis, and principles that each bank follows.
Then this research did a case study by choosing one bank in the UAE under each type of banks. The researsh calculated and analyzed the basic ratios for measuring the growth as the ROA, ROE, net profit margin, net bank operating margin, sustainable growth, and internal growth rates. In addition, it compared the changes and growths in each year in the balance sheet and income statement. This author found that the Islamic banks are more stable and profitable but grow at steady rate. Also, it found that the conventional banks are more fluctuating in the growth rates in both ROA and ROE. They give more profit but more risky. And it gets effected very easily by any financial situation either positive or negative.

Factors Influencing the Choice of Social Network Sites in the Light of Cross-cultural Research

Małgorzata Bartosik-Purgat, Monika Guzek
Poznań University of Economics and Business, Poznań, Poland
The main purpose of the paper is to identify the factors of social networking sites (SNS) that influence individual users’ choice in foreign markets (cultures) and to determine endogenous characteristics (age and gender) differentiating this choice. Besides, the specific objective of the paper is to indicate interdependencies between the importance of particular factors of SNS and the devices used by users. The literature studies have been enriched with empirical studies carried out in China, Poland, and the United States. Empirical research was conducted with the use of a quantitative research method such as paper and electronic inquiry forms (CAWI), filled out by the respondents themselves. Referring to the importance of the characteristic features of SNS, it needs to be emphasized that the results of the empirical studies showed little differences among the researched countries. It was noted that the endogenous characteristics of users, such as gender and age, differentiate the significance of particular elements. The greatest interdependencies between the endogenous factors and the elements of SNS were observed in the Chinese group. The research also showed great significance of mobile devices in using SNS. The presented results have a significant application value for business entities creating SNS and their mobile applications in the foreign market.

Introduction
Nowadays, the Internet is a place where people perform many activities which so far have been known only in the offline world. The increased frequency of using the Internet raises the popularity of small sized smartphones, iPads, or tablets. Thanks to them, users can be constantly online. Greater frequency of using the Internet is caused by the appearance of SNS, which has changed and is still changing the activity of users on the Internet. Many of them cannot imagine living only offline life as SNSs enable cooperation, and allow users to actively participate in bilateral communication and involve in virtual life. Through SNS, users can, on the one hand, express their opinions on the products they have bought; while on the other hand, they actively participate in the process of creating new products, thus becoming prosumers. In fact, SNSs are a common platform for exchanging content created by users, they support active users and ensure the control of the content (e.g. inappropriate photos, posts offending social, ethnic groups, etc.) (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010).

Because of varying needs of users, a growing number of new media characterized by specific features have been appearing in the market, e.g. Instagram, Snapchat, Pinterest, Periscope, or Vine, where communication is mainly done through photos and short videos. For some people, mostly, the representatives of the Z generation, media such as Facebook or Twitter become unfashionable. They expect newer, more original, and more specialized solutions. Moreover, the results of the last research done by IRCenter show that more and more often users give up being active in several media simultaneously (Social Media 2014—Polska Raport).
In the international market, a diversified way and use of particular SNS can be observed. It is caused by many factors among which cultural and political elements as well as the degree of development need to be distinguished. Many SNSs are available in the majority of countries in various parts of the world, however, in some markets, communities use local media which are often equivalents of the international ones (Ruleman, 2012). Such a situation takes place for example in China where the community mainly uses Youku instead of YouTube, while RenRen and Qzone are Chinese “substitutes” of Facebook and other Western media (Saw, Abbott, Donaghey, & McDonald, 2013; Zhang & Xueb, 2015).
The character and range of using social media are also influenced by different needs and personality traits (Khang, Han, & Ki, 2014) of the residents of particular markets or regions. Due to these reasons, the factors which users take into account when choosing particular SNS are diversified. These factors are a special area of interest in this paper.
The main purpose of the paper is to identify the factors of SNS that influence individual users’ choice regarding these media in foreign markets (however, it should be emphasized that the range of using media is not discussed by authors as one of the factors). Moreover, the detailed aims also include describing endogenous characteristics that differentiate this choice and indicating interdependence between the importance of particular factors of the media and the devices used by users. The literature studies presented in the first part of the article have been complemented with the empirical research done in the foreign markets. Due to a differentiated structure of the SNS market as well as the potential and directions of interests of companies, the authors focused in the article on three markets: Polish, American, and Chinese ones.
Knowledge about the factors that users take into account when choosing SNS, as well as indicating the significance of personality features that differentiate the choice, is important for both current and future creators of portals. Such information is also significant for companies to place the advertisements of their products there or using these media for another type of communication with potential buyers.
The structure of this article illustrates its main purpose. The first part includes an the literature review according to factors influencing the choice of social media and its determinants as age and gender. Then the methodology and the results of the empirical research are presented, next discussion and finally conclusions.
Literature Review
The literature broadly presents the results of projects related to the frequency and ways of using the Internet in general (Li & Kirkupb, 2007; Lin & Lu, 2011; Bolton, Parasuraman, Hoefnagels, Migchels, Kabadayi, Gruber, … Solnet, 2013; Hamade, 2013), the area of using SNS (K. E. Howard, Curwen, N. R. Howard, & Colon-Muniz, 2014; Hamid, Waycott, Kurnia, & Chang, 2015; Sheldon, 2015), and the determinants differentiating this use. The attempts to indicate a correlation between ways of using SNS and personality of a user, e.g. how extraverts use social media and how it is done by introverts (Ross, E. S. Orr,

SOCIAL NETWORK SITES IN THE LIGHT OF CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH

Sisic, Arseneault, Simmering, & R. R. Orr, 2009; Ryan & Xenos, 2011; Nadkarni & Hofmann, 2012) can most often be observed. In the literature, there are numerous publications presenting studies on using social media in the area of communication, entertainment, education, consumer behaviour, or work (Roblyer, McDaniel, Webb, Herman, & Witty, 2010; Gammon & White, 2011; Nicholas, Watkinson, Rowlands, & Jubb, 2011; Ruleman, 2012; Tenopir, Volentine, & King, 2013; Zhang, Liu, de Pablos, & She, 2014), however, it is difficult to find the studies and scholarly publications which are closely related to the issues discussed in this article. The paper is an attempt to fill out a gap which exists in this area of the literature on the subject. This attempt aims at identifying the factors which are taken into account when choosing media by individuals (as well as the influence of the personal characteristics) in the international context. It needs to be emphasized that the authors of various scholarly publications refer to factors conditioning a choice of particular SNS, however, it is mainly done from the point of view of enterprises (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010; Ainin, Parveen, Moghavvemi, Jaafar, & Shuib, 2015; Siamagka, Christodoulides, Michaelidou, & Valvi, 2015), and not the point of view of an individual user, as it is presented in this article.
Social Media in Foreign Markets One of the latest popularity rankings (according to the activity of users) of social networking services
(SNS) across the world shows the predominance of Facebook (Figure 1), next places are held by Chinese Qzone, Google+, as well as Instagram and Twitter. Further places in the ranking are mainly related to the origin of social platforms, e.g. Baidu Tieba or Weibo; these media are used in the Chinese market (similarly to Qzone which is listed as the second one), while VKontakte is a popular social platform in Russia (Kemp, 2015; 2016).

The results of the research done by IRCenter in 2014 on the popularity and activity of Polish users in SNS indicate that the leading places, in terms of using a service, are continually held by YouTube (92%) and Facebook (85%), next by Twitter (28%), and Instagram (25%). These studies show that Facebook and Twitter kept the first two places (compared to the previous years) and that the activity of Polish users on internet forums decreased. There are also differences in the frequency of using between the genders. The vast majority of women prefer the blogosphere and Instagram. Men predominate in internet forums and as YouTube users. In

Poland, both genders almost equally use Facebook (with a slight predominance of women 52%/48%), Twitter (women 55%, men 45%), or Google+ (56%/44%). The presented studies show that the activity of Polish women (in a form of publications) in SNS has been increasing in comparison to the years preceding the conducted research (by 7.3%) (Social Media 2014—Polska Raport).
In the latest report on social media in the Chinese market, Kemp (2016) presented the most popular media divided into internet communicators and social services. It stems from these data that the dominant position among the communicators is held by WeChat (24% of people indicated using this medium) which can be named an equivalent of Whatsapp, and Facebook Messenger with a significant difference in the number of users (only 4%). Among SNS, the first place is occupied by Qzone (21%)—the Chinese equivalent of Facebook, next by Sina Weibo (16%), Baidu Tieba (14%), Tencent Weibo (12%), and Renren (6%). Less popular are also the Chinese services such as Kaixin001 (5%) and 51.com (3%). In the discussed ranking, Facebook users were also observed, however, in comparison to the leader of the classification, their number is small—only 6% (Kemp, 2016).
The American market of SNS is dominated, in terms of the number of users, by one of the largest services, which is Facebook. Both the service as such, as well as the communicator, i.e. Facebook Messenger occupies the first places in the rankings. However, in 2015, a one-percent decrease in the number of Facebook users was observed, while the number of Facebook Messenger users increased by 6% (Kemp, 2016). A typical user of Facebook in the United States is not necessarily a young person. A significant percentage of people in the age range of 55+ also use social websites here. The studies done by Experian Simmons show that in the group of people over 55 years old, 82% of Americans are social media users, while among people who turned 65 this percentage equals 73% (Wilmowski, 2015). The measurement done by Realitymine in the American market shows the dominance of Facebook, regardless of age. The distinction is observed in relation to other services, e.g. Google+ is dominated by men from the Baby Boomer generation, the so-called image sharing services (Instagram, Pinterest) are definitely preferred by women from the Millennials generation (the number of women using Pinterest is five times higher than the number of men). Twitter is the only service in this research used mostly by American men, regardless of age (among its users the ones with higher education predominate) (Realitymine, 2015).
Determinants of Choosing Social Networks
Questions need to be asked here. What factors, besides the area of use, influence the choice of a particular SNS? Is it a number of people who already use it and access to a particular number of users? Is it the attractiveness of the interface, being user-friendly or maybe lack of a subscription fee?
In the literature, the factors of choosing SNS by individual users are very often associated with an area of use, e.g. communication and entertainment (Bohn, Buchta, Hornik, & Mair, 2014), looking for study materials (Mora Mora, Signes Pont, Casado, & Iglesias, 2015) and looking for a job (Zappa & Robins, 2016; Chua, 2011). However, in this article, the authors focus on factors other than a way of using SNSs. Guerrero (2015), among the traits essential for the success of a SNS, listed the correct size of an image, its clarity as well as, at the same time, attractiveness and being striking, showing faces and smiles (people love to watch people), using slogans and keywords that attract the auditorium, recognisability through consistent use of the acknowledged signs and symbols and relevance of the placed information and images among others. The studies done among managers of small companies in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and India showed that the factors

442

SOCIAL NETWORK SITES IN THE LIGHT OF CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH

influencing a choice of a particular social tool made by enterprises are the innovative character of media and their geographic range among others (Wamba & Carter, 2013). Moreover, Zeiller and Schauer (2011) emphasized these social media characteristics which ensure providing important and high quality information and their significance for small enterprises. Other most often identified and mentioned determinants of choosing social media by enterprises are mainly compatibility (Y. M. Wang, Y. S. Wang, & Yang, 2010; Ainin et al., 2015), costs related to using a particular medium, and its effectiveness (Chong & Chan, 2012; Ainin et al., 2015), trust (Chai, Das, & Rao, 2011), as well as interactivity and the possibility of reaching broad spectrum of users fast (Lee & Kozar, 2012; Ainin et al., 2015).
Taking into account research achievements of other authors related to distinguishing the factors that influence a choice of SNSs made by individual users, the following research hypothesis has been formulated:
H1: A factor which to the greatest extent determines the choice of SNSs is its geographic range, and thereby the number of users.
The behaviour of SNS’s users is influenced by a number of elements which differentiate the frequency of use, the range, and factors influencing the choice of particular services that are the subject of interest in this article. The determinants conditioning these behaviours are related to the individual characteristics of users, and in the article, they are described as endogenous factors. The studies done by other researchers in the area of using social media show that there is differentiation because of gender (Randall, Pauley, & Culley, 2015; Ruleman, 2012; Muscanell & Guadagno, 2012; McCormick & Livett, 2012; Kozinets, De Valck, Wojnicki, & Wilner, 2010) and age (Ruane & Wallace, 2013; Lenhart, Purcell, Smith, & Zickuhr, 2013; Brenner & Smith, 2013). However, they mainly relate to the significances of using and not the factors of choosing services. The results of the studies where the variables differentiating the behaviour of social media users were endogenous factors, show interdependencies between them and ways of using these services. In other words, the factors such as gender and age differentiate the ways of using SNSs. On these grounds, the second hypothesis and two detailed hypotheses including endogenous characteristics of users of SNSs have been formulated.
H2: Endogenous factors differentiate the significance of particular characteristics of social networking services.
H2a: Age of users differentiates the significance of the characteristics of social networking services when choosing them.
H2b: Gender of users differentiates the significance of the characteristics of social networking services when choosing them.
Another detailed aim described in the introduction of the article is to identify interdependencies between a type of a device applied to use social networking services and the importance of a characteristic feature of these services when choosing them by users. It is an interesting issue, because as a few years ago, the main device used for social networking was a desktop computer or laptop (West & Thompson, 2015). Nowadays, technological development has affected a significant change in the accessibility of social media based on using mostly smartphones, tablets, or iPads for these purposes (Tan & Goh, 2015). The number of people using SNS through mobile devices increases every year. For example, it stems from the report Digital, Social & Mobile Worldwide in 2015 that in August 2015, 23% increase in comparison to 2014 was noted (Kemp, 2015).
The results of the analyses done by Kemp in 2015 and 2016 show a great use of mobile devices, e.g. smartphones and tablets, for social purposes. For example, in Eastern Asia, over 89.6% of active social accounts are mobile accounts, in the North America, this rate is even higher and amounts to 93.8%, in Western

SOCIAL NETWORK SITES IN THE LIGHT OF CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH

443

Europe 84%, while in the South America as much as 74.8% (Kemp 2016). It also stems from the Digital in 2016 Report: We Are Social’s, that the first place, with a significant advantage in the ranking, among the countries where the highest percentage of active social accounts in mobile devices in relation to the size of population was noted, was held by South Korea (76%), next Qatar (66%), Taiwan (64%), United Aran Emirates (61%), Iceland (60%), Hong Kong ( 59%), Singapore (58%), as well as Malesia and the United States (52% each).
The increasing number of people using mobile devices prompts to ponder what is the evaluation of the importance of the characteristics of SNSs when making a choice. To this end, the third hypothesis indicating the interdependence between a type of a device and the evaluation of the characteristics of SNSs pointed out by users as important when choosing a medium has been formulated.
H3: The evaluation of the importance of the characteristics of social networking services is influenced by the type of devices applied by users.
Research Methods
Empirical research was conducted with the use of a quantitative research method such as paper and electronic inquiry forms (CAWI), filled out by the respondents themselves. The standardized questionnaire is an original instrument prepared for the purpose of the described research. The only element differentiating the measurement instrument in the researched markets was the language. In order to gather a greater number of filled-out questionnaires, the Polish language was applied in Poland, Chinese in China, and English in the United States. The original language of the questionnaire was Polish, next it was translated into English and Chinese by means of forward and backward translation. It was based on translating the questionnaire from Polish into particular languages, and next again into Polish. The original version was compared with the final one in order to eliminate errors stemming from linguistic, lexical, or context differences (Adams, Madhavan, & Simon, 2006).
Sampling Method and Sample Size Collecting the data in the empirical research was finished at the end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. In
the three countries analysed in this article, the total number of the respondents participating in the research was 851, including 295 from China, 296 from Poland, and 260 from the United States. The respondents were selected by means of one of nonprobability sampling methods (snow ball sampling). In each market, there were people responsible for providing the respondents with questionnaires, either in a paper or electronic version. Applying the online questionnaire did not result in significant response rate (3.5% of all the collected questionnaires). The applied method of sampling produces the consequences related to the interpretation of the obtained results which, in the discussed case, should not be fully generalized for the population of the researched countries, SNS’s users. They are characteristic of particular groups participating in the survey.
Sample Profile The researched groups in particular countries are differentiated by endogenous criteria, among which
gender and age were analysed. Table 1 presents the detailed data obtained in particular countries. It needs to be emphasized that in terms of gender, similar distribution was obtained in the Chinese and Polish groups, where the majority (around 70% of the respondents) were women. In the United States, the group was almost balanced in terms of the participation of men and women.

In terms of age, in the Polish and Chinese groups, the largest parts were people aged between 21-30. In the United States, the age group of 15-20 predominated. In the American and Polish groups, the fewest respondents were from the 31 and older groups, while in China, this class included 19% of the respondents.

Research Results
In order to describe the most important factors (F) of SNSs which are taken into account by users choosing a service, the respondents were asked to point out the five most significant ones from the prepared list of categories. In order to examine the interdependencies between the endogenous characteristics of users (gender and age) and the factors of SNSs, the analysis of statistical indexes demonstrating an interdependence/or its lack was done. In order to determine the importance of the occurrence of differences between the endogenous factors of users and the characteristics of SNSs (generally, without making a distinction between particular services), Pearson’s chi-square statistics was applied. In order to establish the strength of the correlation, Cramer’s V factor was used. Applying the distinguished statistics stems from the characteristics of the scales of measurement used in the questionnaire. Similarly, in order to determine the interdependence between the indicated factors of SNSs and a type of used devices employed by users, Pearson’s chi-square statistics was applied.
Factors of SNSs In all the researched countries (Figure 2), firstly, the number of people (F3), which a user has access to
through a particular medium; secondly, lack of fees for using a service (F7); and, thirdly, being user-friendly was indicated as the most significant characteristic of SNSs (F2). Large convergence was observed in the three researched countries in terms of these three characteristics. The least important for the respondents were the name of the service (F9), availability of social games (F5), as well as presence of advertisements of various products (F11). The greatest differences among the researched countries were obtained in the case of the availability of social games (in China, 4.4% of the respondents indicated this characteristic as important, while in Poland and the United States around 18% in each of the countries), ease of activating an account (the largest number of Poles indicated this feature—70.2% and the fewest were Americans—51.1%), great diversity of functions (62% of the Chinese respondents emphasized the importance of this feature when choosing SNSs, 43.6% of Poles, and 34.6% of Americans), and the possibility of using a mobile application of a service (38.9% of the Chinese respondents, 49.6% of the Polish respondents, and 61.1% of Americans).

Figure 2. Factors of SNSs taken into account when choosing (% of indications). Source: own research.
Among the characteristics that influence the choice of a particular service, in the Chinese group, the majority of the respondents indicated the number of people using a given medium (77.9%), lack of fees for using a service (76.6%), ease of use (73.2%), registering an account (65.1%), and variety of functions (62%). Possibility of playing games through a given service turned out to be the least important for the Chinese respondents (4.4%). Similarly, in the Polish group, the factors of the SNSs used by the respondents (which are, at the same time, elements influencing the choice) are mainly: large community (84.4%), being user-friendly and easy to use (80.4%), as well as lack of fees for using a service (78.8%). The name of a service (10.1%), advertisements placed in a service (13.2%), and possibility of playing games through these services (18.2%) are the least important for the Polish respondents. As far as the respondents from the American group are concerned the characteristics they pay attention to when choosing a service, which are also: great number of people—users (77.3%), lack of fees for using (74.6%), ease of use (68.8%), and the possibility of using a service via a mobile device (61.1%)—this is the highest result among the researched countries related to the possibility of using SNSs through mobile devices. The name of a service (8.8%) or advertisements placed there (8.1%) are almost of no importance here.
Properties of SNSs and the Endogenous Characteristics of Users The statistical analysis with the use of chi-square test showed a correlation between the gender of the
respondents and the characteristic factors of SNSs described as a possibility of using a mobile application of a service (F6) in all the presented countries (Table 2). In other words, gender differentiates the significance of this factor when choosing SNSs. In China, women pay more attention to accessing services through mobile devices (p < 0.01; V = 0.14), however, the strength of the relation between gender and this feature is established here, on the basis of V Cramer, as weak. Similarly, in the two other countries, women to a greater extent take into account F6 when choosing SNSs, however, the strength of these relations is also at the weak level (p < 0.05; V = 0.12). In the United States, chi-square test indicated the significance of the interdependence between

446

SOCIAL NETWORK SITES IN THE LIGHT OF CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH

gender and F1. American women more often pay attention to whether it is easy to activate an account in SNSs (p < 0.05; V = 0.12). In the case of other characteristics, gender does not differentiate the significance of particular factors of SNSs.

In relation to age, as an endogenous variable conditioning the choice of SNSs in terms of their specific factors, it can be underlined that age is a variable differentiating the significance of those factors to the greatest extent in the Chinese group. The influence of this variable on the three factors was observed here. In the case of F5 and F9, the youngest Chinese respondents (15-20) particularly take these factors into account (p < 0.05; V = 0.15), when choosing SNSs. Lack of advertisements in a given service (F10) is important for slightly older Chinese respondents (21-30) (p < 0.05; V = 0.15). In the Polish group, age significantly influences the importance of a characteristic related to the ease of using a service (F2). This characteristic turned out to be particularly important for the Polish respondents from the 21-30 age group (p < 0.01; V = 0.18). As far as the youngest Polish respondents (15-20) are concerned the most important factors turned out to be the limited number of advertisements in services (F10) (p < 0.01; V = 0.17). For the youngest American respondents, the fact that using a particular service makes it possible to reach a large community of users (F3) (p < 0.01; V = 0.22) is important. In relation to the remaining characteristics, the respondents (regardless of age) behave similarly in terms of evaluating the distinguished variables when choosing SNSs.
Properties of SNAs and a Type of Mobile Devices Referring to a type of devices used by the respondents when using SNS, three devices most often indicated
in particular groups are needed to be distinguished. These devices are included in the category of the so-called portable or mobile devices, i.e. laptop, tablet/iPad, or smartphone. Only some respondents from the studied groups use desktop computers, however, they were not analysed.
Laptop. In the studied groups (Chinese and American), the same relations were noted. The first one indicates the interdependence between a factor of SNSs which is the attractiveness of interface (F4) and employing laptops to use these media. In other words, using a laptop significantly influences the importance of the F4 characteristic in the Chinese (p < 0.01; V = 0.24) and American (p < 0.05; V = 0.18) groups. Furthermore,

SOCIAL NETWORK SITES IN THE LIGHT OF CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH

447

in these two groups, using a laptop in order to access SNSs significantly influences the importance of a factor which is related with great variety of their functions (F8) (p < 0.02; V = 0.18). In the Polish group, using a laptop significantly influences the importance of F11 which is the presence of advertisements. In other words, the researched poles using SNSs through laptops pay attention to the presence of advertisements of different products in these services (p < 0.05; V = 0.18).

Tablet/iPad. In the case of using SNSs through tablets, more varied interdependencies were observed than in the group of the respondents using laptops. Chi-square test showed in the Chinese group the relation between these users and the importance of F6, i.e. possibility of using a mobile application of a service (p < 0.05; V = 0.18).
In the Polish group, the influence of tablet on F2 (p < 0.05; V = 0.18) and F3 (p < 0.05; V = 0.2) was noted. In the American group tablet users, more than other ones, value higher lack of fees for using social networking services (F7) (p < 0.05; V = 0.2).

Smartphones. The greatest number of interdependencies between a type of a device and the importance of the factors of SNSs was observed in the group of smartphone users. In all the researched countries, using a smartphone significantly influences the importance of F6 which is a possibility of using a mobile application (China: p < 0.01; V = 0.2; Poland: p < 0.05; V = 0.17; the United States: p < 0.05; V = 0.22). This interdependence is related to the degree of mobility as smartphones are considered to be the most mobile among mobile devices. Moreover, in the Chinese and American groups, significant influence of the nature of a device—smartphone—on the importance of F3, i.e. a big number of people using services was presented. The strength of this relation in the Chinese group was established at the moderate level V = 0.3 (p < 0.01), in the American group, this degree is weak V = 0.2 (p < 0.01).

Among the researched Chinese respondents, a significant correlation between the importance of the F2 (p < 0.05; V = 0.19), F5 (p < 0.01; V = 0.19), and F8 (p < 0.01; V = 0.25) characteristics was also observed. In the

SOCIAL NETWORK SITES IN THE LIGHT OF CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH

Polish group, the influence of employing smartphones in order to use SNSs on the presence of advertisements of various products (F11) (p < 0.05; V = 0.17) was obtained.
Discussion
The analysis of the factors which are significant when choosing SNSs showed that all the respondents (regardless of a country) considered the following aspects as the most important ones: firstly, the number of people (F3) a user has access to through a given service; secondly, lack of fees for using them (F7); and thirdly, ease of use (F2). The presented findings are also convergent with the results obtained in other research projects (Wamba & Carter, 2013). Therefore, the first hypothesis which was formulated after the literature studies and which states that a factor which to the greatest extent determining the use of social networking services is its geographic range, and thereby the number of users, has been validated.
Statistical calculations done in a form of chi-square test demonstrated that in all the researched countries there is a correlation between the gender of the respondents and the factors related to the possibility of using a mobile application of a service (F6). Women value higher F6 than men when deciding about the choice of SNS. It can be therefore stated that H2a is true in relation to this factor of SNSs. Taking into account the results differentiating the evaluation of the importance of the factors of SNS while choosing them, it should be stated that age is a significant variable especially in the Chinese group. In each of the remaining groups, one correlation between age and the factors of SNSs was obtained. It can be therefore concluded that H2b is true. The analysis of these interdependencies shows that in the Chinese group, the youngest respondents pay the greatest attention to the possibility of playing social games and an interesting name of a social service. Older Chinese respondents take into account lack of advertisements on the SNSs they use. An interesting fact was noted in the Polish group, where the younger respondents considered the factor related to lack of advertisements as important, while the older ones paid more attention to the ease of use.
The above results have an application value as the knowledge derived from them can be very useful to the creators of SNSs. The information about the importance of characteristics for particular groups of users will make it possible to adjust the offer to their expectations, e.g. services directed toward younger users to a greater extent should enable them to play games through these websites. The youngest Chinese users, however, pay also attention to the name of a service, which is equally important from the point of view of their creators. Services whose users are supposed to be mainly women should offer mobile applications.
The results of the presented studies and carried out analyses also make it possible to determine the attitude of particular users toward advertisements that appear in social media. The characteristic of a service related to the presence or lack of advertisements in it was particularly correlated with age in the Chinese and Polish groups. What is interesting, the Chinese from the age group of 21-30 prefer the services where the presence of advertisements is limited to minimum. Another interesting fact was observed in the Polish group where lack of advertisements was indicated as an important factor influencing the choice of a service in the group of the youngest respondents (age range of 15-20). This information is important for both the creators of SNSs directed towards the segment of younger users, as well as advertisers. The surplus of advertisements on a website, if they are not welcomed, might have negative influence on the attitude towards a service as well as advertised products.
Referring to mobile devices whose users evaluate the importance of particular characteristics of SNSs, it should be highlighted that the largest number of interdependencies were noted among the respondents using

450

SOCIAL NETWORK SITES IN THE LIGHT OF CROSS-CULTURAL RESEARCH

smartphones. Smartphones users, regardless of a country, pay particular attention to the possibility of using SNSs through mobile applications. What is interesting, users of laptops, from two countries—China and Poland—pay attention to the attractiveness of interface of SNSs. It might be related to the limited size of screens in smartphones and tablets. The observed interdependencies between using mobile devices and the evaluation of the importance of particular factors of SNSs allow determining that the hypothesis H3 stating that the evaluation of the importance of the characteristics of SNSs is influenced by the type of devices applied by users is true.
Conclusions
Summing up the conclusions which stem from the literature studies and the statistical analysis of the obtained results in the three culturally diversified groups, it needs to be stated that there are slight differences between the countries in terms of the importance of the factors of SNSs. Endogenous characteristics of users, such as gender and age, differentiate the importance of particular variables. In some cases (e.g. gender), these interdependencies are similar in all three researched groups. However, as far as most aspects are concerned, the results vary. The greatest interdependencies between endogenous characteristics of users and the elements of SNSs were noted in the Chinese group. The creators of services should take into account these characteristics particularly in this market when preparing new offers and implementing changes in already existing ones.
The research also indicated great significance of mobile devices in using SNSs. Slightly different factors are important for laptop users than for smartphone users. The presented results have a significant application value for business entities creating SNS and their mobile applications in the foreign market. These results indicate common areas, as well as the ones that should be adjusted to the expectations of particular users.

Kafkas University, Kars, Turkey
This study examines various aspects of geopolitical rivalry and pragmatic rapproachment moments during the history of relationship between Russia and Saudi Arabia, or the Gulf states in general. In this study, the course of that relationship is considered as the hidden determinative the geopolitical struggles of Middle-East region and also the Russian Middle-East policies. In order to catch the course and progress of Russia-Saudi Arabia relations, this paper includes important historical events related with the Middle-East and Russia’s positions in this region occured after the end of the cold war. In this study, the impacts of Russia-Saudi Arabia relationship on the Russian foreign policy and the region are examined through presenting a brief history since the cold war era, and today’s conditions especially in current issues such as energy market, oil prices, and the Syria conflict. The main aim of this study was to explain how Russia-Saudi Arabia relations have been affected global-level developments such as the effects of 9/11 attacks, US’s war on terror doctrine, Afghanistan and Iraq intervention, the Arab Spring, and the Russian involvement in Syria in September 2015 and what are the conditions of rapproachment and conflict in the dynamic nature of Middle-East politics.
Keywords: Russia-Saudi Arabia Relations, Russia’s middle east policy, pragmatic geopolitical rivalry, rapproachment
The History and Global Developments
The relationship between Russia and Saudi Arabia is relatively new phenomenon and can be regarded as unfriendly at the beginning in regional geopolitical basis (Terterov, 2009, p. 156). The important components of that relationship are sometimes based on the Saudi Arabia’s support for fundamentalists or jihadists in post-soviet region and as another reality of the Middle-East region and Russian foreign policy, Russia’s support to Iran composes the geopolitical rivalry between Russia and Saudi Arabia as major powers in regional/global scope (Nocetti, 2010, p. 4). The tensions caused by differences in ideologies and regional struggle for interest became the main determinant of the relationship between Russia and Saudi Arabia both in Soviet times and in Russia Federation era. However, as global political balance shifts and game-changing developments are happening in Middle-East region, the traditional unfriendly relationship concept between Russia and Saudi

454 GEOPOLITICAL RIVALRY AND THE CONDITIONS OF PRAGMATIC RAPPROACHMENT
Arabia faced the possibility of rapproachment especially in 2000s (World Politics Review, n.d.). But that real-political rapproachment possibility does not mean the conventional division issues and rivalry have been overcomed. Russia and Saudi Arabia still remain controversial in some critical issues such as the energy market, the future of Syria, rise of Islamism, etc. So the Russia-Saudi relationship naturally depends on their different interests in the controversial issues as energy market and the dynamic nature of political situation of the Middle-East. Although that is the reality of Russian foreign policy and the Middle-East, Russia aims to reassert its presence in the Arab world by restoring its image and influence in the regional issues through increasing its relations with the Gulf States as major powers of the region (Nocetti, 2010, p. 4).
The relationship is also under the influence of global politics. And after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the first most important global development was the 9/11 attacks in United States. This international-level development became one of the most considerable factors of shaping the Middle-East as a result of the change in US foreign policy concept towards the “War on Terror”. Along with the Russia’s Western-inclined and non-interventionlist foreign policy concept in the Yeltsin era (Tsygankov, 2010, pp. 58-59), the relationship between Arab World and Russia became considerably declined. However, at the same time, in that unipolar period, Russian foreign policy was dealing with preventing the ınternational terrorism and Islamist fundamentalism to enter the Russia Federation. That was a national security issue for Russia Federation because there was the Islamist and separatist movements that could destabilize the Russian Federation’s southern region. Another important matter of international developments for Russia was to maintain and sustain its advantage in main strategic sectors such as energy, oil, fuel, nuclear energy, and arms production.
Another subsequent outcome of the changing global political environment for Russia Federation after the 9/11 attacks and the US’s “War on Terror” doctrine is the decline of Americal power and the emergence of rising powers since the beginning of 2000s. That situation, the weakening of American power, and determinance in international level have presented a great opportunity for Russia Federation especially together with the fact that, in Russia, the geopolitical aspirations for reclaimining Russia Federation’s super-power status and reasserting political influence of Russia over the Post-Soviet territies became stronger in Russian political scene. Therefore for Russia Federation, increasing the relationship with the ArabWorld, Russia could reach the benefits of weakening of the US’s credibility and influence in theregion, and Russia gained a strong opportunity for presenting itself as a counterweight to Western dominated ınternational politics.
Briefly, Russian-Saudi Arabia relations emerged as an opportunity that promises interests for each side. And that increased relationship was parallel with the new orientations of Russian foreign policy which sees the Middle-East as a geopolitical sphere of influence for pusuing the new goals of Russian foreign policy such as reasserting super-power status and confronting the US’s unipolarity (Tsygankov, 2010, p. 188). So the possibility of rapprochement between Russia and Saudi Arabia affects some contradictions and limits of Russian policy with regard to the Arab-Muslim world. However, the traditional cooperation between Russia and Iran remains to have priority for Moscow in regional scope. And Russia applies a policy for promoting its interests, which makes the balances of the Middle-East more complex.
Russia-Saudi Arabia Relations After the Cold War
The position of Gulf Region and the Saudi Arabia in Russian Foreign Policy concept has generally been stable during the cold war. The Cold War Era witnessed an exhibition of mutual opposition and hostility between the USSR-backed actors in Middle East and in the opposite the Saudi-backed actors in South

GEOPOLITICAL RIVALRY AND THE CONDITIONS OF PRAGMATIC RAPPROACHMENT 455
Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Ethiopia, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The Saudi-backed Islamist’s insurgency in Afghanistan started in 1979 was one of the most outstanding examples of that confront (Rajan, 2015, p. 190). In that point, the collapse of the USSR produced advantage for the Saudi side as it can use the financial and humanitarian source for encouraging fundamentalists in the Post-Soviet areas and even within the borders of Russia itself, while the oil production and prices in the global market issues continued to be dependent on Saudi Arabia and other gulf states. As the post-cold war times progressed the process of change in Russia-Saudi Arabia relations started in 9/11 was improved after the 2003 Iraq intervention (National Interest, n.d.). The financial effect of that intervention in energy market considerably increased the oil prices (Macleansa, 2014), which has brought important advantages for both Saudi Arabia and Russia and the traditional frictions started to reduce.
That improvements represented pragmatism in Russian foreign policy. In that period, Russian relations with third parties such as Syria and Iran which are relevant with both Russia’s and Saudi Arabia’s attitutes in the region were not altered. There were also some various controversies in Russia-Saudi Arabia relations. Russia had close relationship with Iraq in Saddam Hussein’s era and that reality was declining the possibility of condifence in Russia-Saudi Arabia relationship. And as another fact the weaponry trade between Russia and Iran especially on the sale of missile weapons and nuclear technology and Russia’s improved relationship with Israel were main points of Russia-Saudi Arabia incompability (Katz, 2001, p. 617).
INTernational developments and globally increasing demand for energy and rise of prices bring Russia and Saudi Arabia relatively closer, geopolitical realities, and struggle for regional power maximization still in advance within the Russia-Saudi Arabia relations. Russia Federation was facing with the first serious domestic problem after the USSR era, the autonomous republic of Chechnya. Saudi Arabia with the sake of alleged leadership on the Sunni Muslim World, was supporting the separatists in the Russian Autonomous Republic of Chechnya (Katz, 2008, p. 3). This fact completely dismissed any possibilities of cooperation between two sides. Russia regarded Saudi Arabia as supporter of Taliban to harm Russian interests. In addition, Moscow blamed Saudi Arabia for fostering radical Islamism among Muslims in Russia and post-soviet territories. Tensions between the two side increased after Russia’s reoccupation of Chechnya in 1999. That reoccupation was seen as inhuman act against Chechnya’s Muslims by the Saudi Arabia (Katz, 2008, p. 3). In that fluctuated period, the highest official development in Russia-Saudi relations was the visit of Saudi Prince Abdullah to Moscow in 2003. It was an important attempt for improving Russian-Saudi relationship.
The main factors at the backgroud of that possible reconciliation were primarily the US’s intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq based on War on Terror doctrine. Afghanistan and Iraq were the major controversial areas of Russia-Saudi geopolitical rivalry since the cold war. Historically, Saudi Arabie had ties with the Taliban and Russia was supporting Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq. Another factor was that, since Putin came to power in Russia, the US-Russian relationship started to be strained. And that made Russia to seek alternative actors and openings against US dominance and Western influence in the post-Soviet regions. The Saudi Arabia could present the required alternative for Russian foreign policy. At the beginning of the post-9/11 world, the US-led intervention in Afghanistan was supported by Putin’s Russia with the aim of cooperating against international terrorism, Islamist extremism and improving Russia-Western relationship by rendering Washington’s regard Moscow as a strategic partner against Chechnya possible. In that period, both United States and Russia Federation were seeing Saudi Arabia as a main source or supporter of Islamist groups. However, Russia’s consideration has completely changed after the launch of US intervention in Iraq in 2003. The operation was

456 GEOPOLITICAL RIVALRY AND THE CONDITIONS OF PRAGMATIC RAPPROACHMENT
objected by both Moscow and Riyadh, and Putin’s Russia started to abandon the Westernist’s ideas in foreign policy and became more sceptical about US foreign policy and the Western powers. In that picture, Saudi Arabia became a potential ally against US dominance absolutely with Iran. This process was strenghtened by the increasing strains in the Saudi-US relationship convinced Saudi Arabia on that improving relations with Russia could be useful. Afterwards, in the following years, Russia and Saudi Arabia have improved relations in various realms. And the both sides claimed share the same view terrorism and announced that they would coordinate in counter-terrorism. Thus, the Chechnya’s issue was no more the breaker of Russia-Saudi Arabia relations.
In 2007, Russian leader Putin visited Saudi Arabia for the purpose of increasing business relations with Saudi Arabia (Smith, 2007). In 2006, direct flights between Saudi Arabia and Russia were initiated as a representative of improving bilateral relations (Nocetti, 2010, p. 16). Both sides had interest in this process. Russia was in need of foreign investment for sustaining economic growing and stability and Saudi Arabia was looking for protected and stable economic areas in order to make investment. Thus, increased volume of the mutual trade and investment was acceptable for both sides. Russian entrance in the Saudi Arabia’s economy is mostly in the energy sector. Mutual accords, agreements, and contracts were signed between Russian and Saudi energy firms in that process (Nocetti, 2010, p. 16). In that economic relationship, Russia was willing to benefit its advantage in weapon and nuclear sectors and tried to sell weapons and nuclear technology to the Saudi Arabia. And for Saudi Arabia, purchasing Russian weapons could be a useful trump against American arms firms which are traditionally selling weapons to the Saudi Arabia. And because the Saudi-Iranian Saudi Arabia was strained to reach nuclear technology, so Russian entrance in Saudi Arabian economy was promising interests for both sides as seen.
The improvement of bilateral relations had impacts on Russian Middle-East politics. Russia attentively tried to protect the balance between its relationship with Iran and Saudi Arabia. Putin’s Russia pragmatically attempted to exploit the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran for the purpose of selling arms for both sides. However, Iran was taking assistance from Russia in nuclear energy program and that fact holds the unconfidence in Russia-Saudi Arabia Relations. Another component of contradiction in Russia’s Middle-East policies relevant with Saudi Arabia was that Russia’s sale of weaponry to Syria which is considered as Iranian proxy power by Saudi Arabia. As Saudi-Syrian relations being deteriorated Russian pragmatic foreign policy continued and led Russia to exploit the rivalry. Actually that times was relatively stable and favourable period in Russia-Saudi Arabia relations compared to the cold war years. However, Russia’s changing foreign policy concept in the course of time and rethinking of identity estranged Russia’s regional vision in Middle-East. The most important signal was the Arab Awakening started in 2010.
The Arab Spring Period and Russian Involvement in Syria
Along with the emergence of the Arab Spring, Russia’s political influence in the Middle East which was increasingly declining after the collapse of the Soviet Union reduced even further because of the component actors and ideologies of the Arab Spring. Russia at the beginning viewed the process as Western-backed developments for expanding Western influence against Russia Federation’s hold in the region. Russian scholars have gone through the “color revolutions” experience in which they blamed Western powers to support the pro-Western movements against post-Soviet governments, so they were sceptical about that kind of popular movements. Thus, the Arab Spring declined Russia’s position in the region.

GEOPOLITICAL RIVALRY AND THE CONDITIONS OF PRAGMATIC RAPPROACHMENT 457
The Arab Spring process in the Russia’s Middle-East politics has shaped the Russia-Saudi Arabia relationship and brought that two powers confronted especially after the Arab Spring spreaded to Syria. In the Syria issue, Russia federation considered the civil commotion as a Western-backed operation against Russia’s traditional ally Bashar Al Assad’s government. And as the opposition groups in Syria who confronts with the Assad became radicalized the Saudi Arabia and Gulf states’ support to anti-Assad groups have appeared. Thus, the fluctuated relationship between Russia and Saudi Arabia became clearly conflictual. As the conflicts continue in Syria among opposition groups, terrorist organizations, and the Syrian government while Russia supports Assad’s position in Syria and regards his government as the only legitimate actor, the situation in Syria has not reached a consequence since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, however, Saudi Arabia’s position has undergone significant change.
As conflicts continuing in the September 2015, Russia initiated an air campaign in Syria and started a comprehensive intervention in Syria including bombings of the Islamic anti-Assad coalition and the ISIS. As a consequence of the early intervention times, the Sunni front allegedly backed by the Saudi Arabia has weakened. And the Saudi Arabia, therefore forced to reach a compromise in Syrian issue. Russian intervention did not faced with a strong reaction from the Arab League. And Saudi Arabia and Qatar could only do a statement for calling Russia to end its operation against the opposition groups.
The relationship between Russia and Saudi Arabia which is among the most determinant factors in any settlement of the Syrian war, has changed after Russian involvement in Syria and Saudi officials have negotiated with Russian encounters in several times including the purchase of the two former Russian vessels. And Saudi Arabia decided to promise to put $10 billion wealth fund into the Russian economy. And weaponry orders of Saudi Arabia from the Russia have come to the agenda.
In that phase, Russia’s rapproachment with Saudi Arabia was based on Russia’s aim to decline the oil production with Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and controll oil prices in global market. The actual matters of Russia-Saudi Arabia relations were about the rise of prices in oil market, selling arms to Saudi Arabia for Russia and to have an influence over the Syrian transition period, and providing alternative cooperation possibility to decline Russia-Iran alliance for the Saudi Arabia.
Conclusion
The relationship between Russia and Saudi Arabia is traditionally referred with regional geopolitics in the Middle-East since the cold war period. The unfriendly relationship was caused by differences in ideologies and regional struggle for interest and threat perceptions of both side from each other. However, as global political conditions and balances shift with significant events such as 9/11 attacks or the Arab Spring, Russia’s foreign policy concept and position in the face of regional countries are being changed. And as a result of that changes, different possibilities in Russia-Saudi Arabia relations gained the possibility of rapproachment in 2000s as seen in this study.
In accordance with the pragmatic foreign policy attitude of Russia Federation in Putin’s era, Russia looks for its changing interests in the controversial issues such as energy market and the dynamic nature of political situation of the Middle-East while configuring its Middle-East policy and relationship with Saudi Arabia. Russia aims to reassert its presence in the Arab world, and sometimes pragmatically attempted to exploit the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran for the purpose of selling arms for both sides, configuring oil prices, and confronting the United States in regional issues.

458 GEOPOLITICAL RIVALRY AND THE CONDITIONS OF PRAGMATIC RAPPROACHMENT

The most important turning point in recent years in the Russia-Saudi Arabia relationship was the Arab Spring and especially after the Arab Spring spreaded to Syria. As a consequence of the early intervention times, the Sunni front allegedly backed by the Saudi Arabia has weakened across the Russia and the Saudi Arabia, therefore forced to reach a compromise in some disputes. As seen in the study, the actual matters of Russia-Saudi Arabia relations were about the rise of prices in oil market, selling arms to Saudi Arabia for Russia.

The Impact of Higher Education on Environmental Risk Perceptions

Eren Durmuş-Özdemir, Sevinç Şener Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey
The purpose of the present study is to explain if there is any difference in the environmental risk perceptions of university students and the association of such differences, if any, with environmental education. Nowadays, the importance of education in understanding the risks that threaten the environment and suggesting solutions for such risks and raising awareness on environmental matters has become an important research question. It is known that higher education is the level of education where individuals are able to attain environmental awareness. Hence, it is necessary to investigate the university students’ environment risk perceptions related to environment education. The present study is a relational study with a descriptive pattern aimed to describe the relationship between university students’ environment risk perceptions and environment education. The “Environmental Risk Perceptions” questionnaire was the basic data collection tool of this study. The questionnaire was tested in a pilot study with 250 university students and it was revised according to the feedback obtained from these students. The revised version of the questionnaire was used in the field study which was conducted through face-to-face interviews with 570 university students actively attending in Vocational College of Technical Sciences of Akdeniz University in Turkey from January 2015 to May 2016. The obtained data from the questionnaires are analyzed through the SPSS statistical package program. The current study found that a significant positive relationship was found between the students’ environment education and their environmental risk perceptions. Students responding to the study stated that taking at least 1 course on environment during their university education had an impact on all aspects of their environmental risk perception. The great majority of students expressed that university education had improved their sensitivity towards environmental matters and they knew about the prominent non-governmental organizations active in the field of environment and became members to such organizations owing to their education. The results of the present study indicate that the formal education and non-formal learning processes offered at vocational colleges with respect to matters concerning the environment have an impact upon students. In fact, the present study gives way to the opinion that the addition of courses on environmental matters to all programmers creates a difference in the environmental risk perceptions of students.

HIGHER EDUCATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PERCEPTIONS

Introduction
The aim of the this study is to explain if there is any difference in the environmental risk perceptions of university students and the association of such differences, if any, with environmental education. Environmental risk perception has been an important research field among educators and academic scholars worldwide for a long time. This prolonged and heightened interest in environmental risk perception is prompted by several factors. Especially for developed economies, environmental risk perception can be constructed by providing the type of education that will teach sensitive individuals correct behaviors. Moreover, it is accepted that education is the most effective way to resolve environmental problems (Duan & Fortner, 2010). It is stated that importance of a quality environmental education and the environmental risk perception education provides for the permanent solution of environmental problems (Monroe, Andrews, & Biedenweg, 2007). However, it has a more critical role for developing countries since environment awareness is seen as an engine of environmental education progress and social adjustment. Thus, environment education formation is widely encouraged by national educational policies to stimulate social conscious.
The objective expected to be achieved in environmental education was designated at the Intergovernmental Environmental Education Conference held for the first time in Tbilisi through the cooperation between United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP). The objective of environmental education is defined in the Tbilisi Declaration as training individuals in consciousness, knowledge, attitudes, and skills concerning environmental issues and ensuring their participation in their solution (Tbilisi Declaration, 1977). It is known that environmental education commences in the family and close circle of individuals should be developed further through elementary, secondary, and higher education. Especially, higher education is the level of education where individuals are able to attain environmental awareness. Some studies stressed that raising individuals with environmental risk perception is only possible with an effective higher environmental education (Ateş & Karatepe, 2013; Selim, Karakuş, Elkan, & Selim, 2011).
In parallel with developing interest in environmental awareness throughout the world, Turkey has also witnessed an increasing interest in environmental education field both between her academic scholars, and educators. In Turkey, however, it is striking that there is no national policy regarding environmental education at the higher education level, whereas basic knowledge of the environment is offered under different courses in the curricula of elementary and secondary schools (Oğuz, Çakıcı, & Kavas, 2011). Although there is still a small body of research addressing the issue of environmental education and environmental risk perception with university students in Turkey, it can also be observed that the number of studies is increasing gradually (Çabuk & Karacaoğlu, 2003; Erdoğan, 2013; Oğuz et al., 2011; Sam, Gürsakal, & Sam, 2010; Talay, Gündüz, & Akpınar, 2004). Therefore, it doesn’t seem to be possible to suggest that there is a nation-wide standardized educational infrastructure or practice relating to the matters of environment (Oğuz et al., 2011). It can be stated that there is a need to make changes in the high level environmental education provided in Turkey. Setting off from this point, the aim of the present study is to explain whether there are any differences in the environmental risk perceptions of university students and to explain the association between such differences and environmental education, if any. For this purpose, we predicted that “delivery of environmental courses to students affects their environmental risk perceptions”; departments offering education to students affect their environmental risk perceptions” and “the sensitivity of students on environmental matters affects their environmental risk perceptions”.

The paper is organized as follows: The first section summarizes the relevant literature and explains the derivation of the four research hypotheses. The methodology and findings of the field study on a sample of 570 students in the Vocational College of Technical Sciences of Akdeniz University in Turkey are presented in the next section. The findings are discussed and some recommendations are offered for further research in the last section.
Literature Review
Environmental Risk Perception Human beings that form a part of the environment have strived to manage the ecological environment
throughout history for their various needs. Productive and consumptive predispositions increased among populations specifically along with the development of the modern consumption society and the environmental balance embarked upon a rapid course of disruption (Kırcı, 2014). Upon the onset of a series of damages to the ecological system, the environment, once managed by humans, started to influence them. Such factors as the rapidly changing environment, increasing environmental pollution and changes in the structure of raw materials for consumption caused humanity to be faced with environmental risks (Ağbuğa, 2016). Environmental risks can be characterized as threats to society that accrue from the interaction of technology and nature. Therefore, it covers a multitude of sins, including air and water pollution, food safety, noise, technological accidents, waste facilities, global warming, acid rain, and ozone depletion. In other words, environmental risks are usually understood as any environmental hazards or processes with potentially negative consequences (Böhm & Pfister, 2000; Kasperson, Kasperson, & Dow, 2001).
The concept of environmental risk can be specified as the expression of the results of the impact of any activity or disputation on the environment in general terms and the state of being exposed to such impact (Slimak & Dietz, 2006), while there is another definition combining an irreversible ecological threat posed by globalization against plants, animals and humans and the state of being systematically faced with such threats arising from the modernization process (Beck, 1992). According to Kasperson et al. (2001) environmental risk is the threat to human beings and what they value from natural or human-driven hazards associated with global change. It is rather difficult to interpret the concept of risk for the environment and for activities concerning the environment and such interpretation requires a different perspective (Kahraman, 2002). Hence, risks from environmental change can be perceptible different perspectives. For example, Duan and Fortner (2010, p. 2) stated that environment risk should be analyzed by social, economic, cultural, and political perspectives to explore public concerns, such as how risks are framed in social processes or how the public responds to and evaluates various environmental risks. Thus it needs to explain not only physical processes, but also public perceptions to provide more insights for environmental risk management. At the centre of this debate, the concept of environmental risk perception has been playing a key role as it could be considered the central part of environmental risks.
Despite the plurality of environmental risk perception in the literature, there is no global consensus on exact definition of the term. Some scholars described environmental risk perception as traditional pollution-based environmental issues form industry, agriculture; as human activities that directly or indirectly contribute to ecological systems degradation; as resource shortage; as global environmental issues and dynamic processes (Lai & Tao, 2003; Slimak & Dietz, 2006; Steg & Sievers, 2000). In other studies, environmental risk perception has been defined as a subjective judgment that people make about the characteristics of

HIGHER EDUCATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PERCEPTIONS

environmental risks (Anantho, 2008; Zhang et al., 2012). For this reason, there are a number of studies that have investigated the perceptions of environmental risk that concern socio-cultural and demographics factors (Fernández-Manzanal, Rodríguez-Barreiro, & Carrasquer, 2007; Riechard & Peterson, 1998; Van der Linden, 2015). For example, the empirical study conducted by Riechard and Peterson (1998) demonstrated significantly higher perceptions of risk among females as opposed to males for environmental hazards.
Relevant academic studies underline the fact that education is the other important social variable in the process of improving environmental risk perception (Duan & Fortner, 2010; Payne, 2016; Sam et al., 2010). Environmental education is defined as the process of training prevalent, creative, responsible, collaborative, and environmentally literate citizens in a democratic society. Although issue of socio-cultural and demographics factors and their influence on perceptions of environmental risk has been examined for more than 30 years, recent researches are still interested in issue of whether environmental education can affect environmental risk perception (Young, Kuob, & Chiangc, 2015).These studies express that individuals with education and sensitivity assume more active roles in the solution of environmental issues. For example, Sam et al. (2010) stated that university students’ environmental risk perceptions were high and there was a strong positive relationship between their environmental risk perceptions and environmental attitudes. However, as one of the social variables, environmental education is considered to be a factor of significance in raising sensitivity on environmental matters among individuals (Duan & Fortner, 2010; Işıldar, 2008; Oğuz et al., 2011).
The present study regards the question as to whether environmental education received in the past or in the current situation by university students in Turkey creates any differences in their environmental risk perceptions and whether these differences, if any, provide meaningful contributions to the process of environmental protection as a worthy subject for research.
Environmental Education
Even though its roots date back to such philosophers as Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778), who argued that there had to be a connection between education and environment, the importance of environmental education in the international arena was emphasized for the first time at the Intergovernmental Environmental Education Conference held for the first time in Tbilisi through the cooperation between UNESCO and UNEP in 1977. This conference added an international dimension through the attention attributed to the importance of environmental education (Tbilisi Declaration, 1977).
Environmental education is offered in the national system of education in Turkey where general education is delivered at the formal and non-formal levels (Çolakoğlu, 2010). Formal educational departments impart only activities to protect the environment to students in the scope of environmental education, but cannot create an environmental consciousness or a higher skill of thinking on such matters as environmental ethics and environmental risks. This need can only be satisfied at the higher education level (Çakır, İrez, & Doğan, 2010). Nevertheless, there is no distinctive curriculum for environmental education at the level of higher education, whereas basic information on the environment is offered under different courses in elementary and secondary school curricula (Çolakoğlu, 2010). However, some studies demonstrate that environmental education should commence in the family and close circle of individuals and be developed further through elementary, secondary and higher education (Çabuk & Karacaoğlu, 2003; Erdoğan, 2013; Erol & Gezer, 2006). These studies consider environmental education as the one that covers all segments of the society and identify young generation as the

HIGHER EDUCATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PERCEPTIONS

463

most important target group because the young generation is considered as the group that will be influenced most adversely by today’s environmental problems and thus requires knowledge, awareness, and sensitivity about environment although they are not liable for such problems. Indeed, current academic findings have indicated that higher education is the level of education where individuals are able to attain environmental consciousness (Çakır et al., 2010; Duan & Fortner, 2010; Işıldar, 2008; Oğuz et al., 2011; Öztaş & Kalipci, 2009; Sadık, & Çakan, 2010; Sam et al., 2010; Şahin, Ünlü, & Ünlü, 2016).
There is no specific nationally adopted or implemented policy concerning environmental education in Turkey at the higher education level. Universities formulate curricula and course contents in the framework of their own institutional structure. Furthermore, universities have established environmental research centers both to work on environmental issues and to act as an advisory board for public authorities. Despite all these efforts, the desired level of efficiency cannot be achieved in practice, leading to the ignorance of the interdisciplinary nature of environment and environmental issues (Çolakoğlu, 2010). Therefore, it doesn’t seem to be possible to suggest that there is a nation-wide standardized educational infrastructure or practice relating to the matters of environment (Oğuz et al., 2011). However, it is important to provide mandatory environmental courses at a range of educational levels through a specific educational policy in the process of raising environmental consciousness (Yurtseven, Vehid, Köksal, & Erdoğan, 2010), since environmental education provides relevant information to individuals in ecological sense and enables them to improve their attitudes towards the environment and to transform such attitudes into behavior.
Academic studies conducted in the field of environmental education in Turkey at the higher education level demonstrated an increase as of the year 2010 (Ateş & Karatepe, 2013; Çakır et al., 2010; Oğuz et al., 2011; Sam et al., 2010; Şahin et al., 2016; Yurtseven et al., 2010). A part of the studies in relevant literature assessed the awareness and sensitivity of higher education students with respect to environmental issues and their environmental attitudes and environmental consciousness (Çabuk & Karacaoğlu, 2003; Erten, 2005; Işıldar, 2008; Oğuz et al., 2011; Öcal, 2013; Selim et al., 2011; Yılmaz & Arslan, 2011), while a lesser number of such studies identified the risk perception in environmental matters (Kahyaoğlu, 2012; Sam et al., 2010;Yurtseven et al., 2010). Also, the low number of detailed research and analyses on the importance of environmental risk perceptions among students of vocational colleges at the higher education level in Turkey was considered to be a significant shortcoming in literature. This study attempts to fill the research gap on the relationship between environmental risk perceptions and higher education level by testing the findings of the relevant literature in the context of the university in Antalya, Turkey.
The study aims to serve for the rectification of this shortcoming. Basing on the above mentioned theoretical and empirical findings in the literature, the following hypotheses are proposed:
H1: Delivery of environmental courses to students affects their environmental risk perceptions. H2: Departments offering education to students affect their environmental risk perceptions. H3: The sensitivity of students on environmental matters affects their environmental risk perceptions.
Method
Research Design The present study is a relational study with a descriptive pattern aimed to explain the relationship between
university students’ environment risk perceptions and environment education. Indeed, the university students will be the leaders of decision makers of institutions, and their concerns and opinions about environmental risks

are valuable for educators to recognize, understand, and adjust to the unique culture of a society for effectively addressing and managing environmental change (Duan & Fortner, 2010, p. 3).

Research Sample
The revised version of the questionnaire was used in the field study which was conducted with 570 university students from Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Sciences, Environment and Agricultural Sciences departments in located in Vocational College of Technical Sciences of Akdeniz Universityin Turkey. This sample was derived from a population of 627 students from Vocational College of Technical Sciences of Akdeniz University. This sample in total represents 91% of the university students from whole population.

Research Instruments and Procedure
The environmental risk perceptions questionnaire was the basic data collection tool of this study. For the purpose of testing the above stated hypotheses a questionnaire was designed by the authors, including an environmental risk perceptions scale adapted from Altunoğlu and Atav (2009), Slimak and Dietz (2006), and Weber, Hair Jr, and Fowler (2010). This questionnaire was tested in a pilot study with 250 students and it was revised according to the feedback obtained from these students. The revised version of the questionnaire was used in the field study which was conducted through face-to-face interviews with students from January 2015 to May 2016. The resultant questionnaire about environmental risk perceptions of the university students consisted of three parts. First part contained some relevant information about the some demographic information; second part contained environmental education of the students; and third part contained environmental risk perceptions.

Validity and Reliability
The gathered data from questionnaires are analyzed through a factor analysis of principal component extraction method with a Varimax-rotation in SPSS 21.0, yielding 7 items for ecological, 6 items for chemical, 4 items for biological and 4 items for global with factor loadings over 0.50 as in Table 1. With these 21 items measuring environmental risk perceptions, the cumulative variance explained is 61.10%, which is above the acceptable limit of 60%. The KMO measure of sampling adequacy is 0.79 which is an acceptable value and close to 1. The value of Bartlett test of sphericity which indicates sufficient correlation between the variables is 827.71 and it is significant (p = 0.000). The factor loadings for the items range from 0.57 to 0.80. Consequently all the mentioned results of factor analysis are in acceptable range (Lewis-Beck, 1994).

According to Table 2, global risk perception has the highest average value (4.08 ± 0.64), followed by chemical risk perception (3.72 ± 0.62), ecological risk perception (3.65 ± 0.63) and biological risk perception (3.37 ± 0.69) receiving the lowest value.

Data Analysis The research data were analyzed through use of the statistical package program. First, the study confirmed
whether data provided the general requirements of the parametric tests. In addition, the Kolomogrov Smirnov test assessed whether the data were distributed normally (KSZ = 0.14, p > 0.05). As a result of the analyses, the data demonstrated normal distribution. Second, descriptive statistics, correlations, T-test and analysis of variance were used during the data analysis.

Results
Sample Profile The first part of questionnaire contained demographic information about the students. Sixty percent of all
respondents were male. The respondents’ ages were mostly between 16 and 25, and nearly all of the

466

HIGHER EDUCATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PERCEPTIONS

respondents were single. Of the 570 participants who noted level of education, 58% reported first year of university and 42% reported second and above years of university. The scope of the research examined the students within the programs they attend 50% electrical and electronic engineering, 20% environment and agriculture sciences, with the remaining 30% civil engineering, mechanical engineering, computer sciences.

Descriptive Findings
The second part of questionnaire contained environmental education of the university students. The specific questions were dedicated to the respondents’ perception on environmental topics and environmental education. Eighty-eight percent of the students in the sample stated that they had received education on environmental matters only by their families since their childhood and had not received any environmental education in their years preceding university. Sixty percent of the students expressed that they had taken a course on the environment at least once during their graduate education.
The students were the asked about their opinions concerning the mandatory or optional nature of environmental courses in educational departments and the level of educational life at which such education should be provided. Ninety percent of the students believe that environmental courses should be taught mandatorily throughout the educational life. Thirty percent of the students who gave this response attended electrical and electronic engineering programmes; Thirty percent environmental and agricultural sciences; and 40% mechanical and civil engineering or computer sciences. The students were asked the question “Do you believe that your vocational college/programme showes sufficient sensitivity towards environmental problems and relevant courses?” with respect to the higher education institution they were attending. Ninnty-nine percent of the students stated they believed that their schools showed sufficient sensitivity towards environmental problems and relevant courses.
Finally, the students were asked whether they were sensitive towards the environment. Seventy percent of the students indicated that they were extremely sensitive towards the environment and relevant issues. In addition, the students were asked whether they knew about the prominent non-governmental organizations that were active in the field of environment in Turkey or whether they were members of such organizations. The students indicated the most commonly known non-governmental organizations as TEMA (The Turkish Foundation for Combating Soil Erosion, for Reforestation and the Protection of Natural Habitats), Greenpeace and DHKD (World Wildlife Foundation). Only 10% of the students specified that they were members to the non-governmental organizations listed in the form. All students who responded to this question attend the department on environmental and agricultural sciences.

perception are strongly intercorrelated. These scores are in accordance with the literature (Altunoğlu & Atav, 2009; Slimak & Dietz, 2006; Sam et al., 2010).

T-Test and Analysis of Variance
T-test and analysis of variance were performed to identify if the environmental risk perceptions of students varied depending on the following variables: taking a course about environment during university education, the department attended at the university, the education level of their parents, and their sensitivity to the environment. The effect of taking at least 1 course about environment during university education on the environmental risk perceptions of the students was analyzed by T-test (Table 4). The analysis results represent a significant difference between the two groups divided in terms of their experience with at least 1 course on the environment. The findings showed that all averages pertaining to environmental risk perceptions were significantly higher among those who had taken a course on the environment than those of students who had not received such a course. A review of the average and standard deviation values pertaining to the dimensions of environmental risk perceptions revealed that the global risk perception (4.14 ± 0.46) had the highest average than the other dimensions. In this situation, taking an environmental course can be stated to have the highest impact on the dimension of global risk perception.

The departments attended by the university students and their effects on their environmental risk perceptions were examined through variance analysis. According to the analysis, it was found out that the departments attended by the students had an impact on all variables of environmental risk perception. Departments that lead to differentiation in the dimensions of environmental risk perceptions were analyzed through Tukey-B test. As a result of the analysis, students of the department on environmental and agricultural sciences were observed to have a higher average in environmental risk perception than those attending other departments. As regards the averages, it was found that the students of the department on environmental and agricultural sciences had the highest average in the global risk perception (Mean = 4. 25; p = 0.000**) among the dimensions.
The sensitivity of students towards environmental issues was analyzed in terms of its impact on environmental risk perceptions through the t-test (Table 6). As a result of the analysis, a significant difference was identified between students who claimed to be sensitive to the environment and students who answered this question negatively. The findings showed that all averages pertaining to the environmental risk perception of environmentally sensitive students were higher than those of the other group. A review of the average and standard deviation values pertaining to the dimensions of environmental risk perceptions revealed that the global risk perception had the highest average than the other dimensions (4.57 ± 0.42). In other words, environmentally sensitive students can be stated to be sensitive mostly towards global environmental risk factors.

Discussion and Conclusion
Industrializations and modernization started to disrupt ecological balances around the whole world. Environmental issues including the exhaustion of gene and energy resources, extinction of species, and reduction in arable agricultural land have become global problems. Now, the perception of individuals towards environmental issues and the effect of education on such perceptions have become prominent in the academic field. The importance of education in understanding the risks that threaten the environment and suggesting solutions for such risks and raising awareness on environmental matters has become an important research question. Research studies undertaken in Turkey demonstrate that environmental education should commence in the family and close circle of individuals and be developed further through elementary, secondary, and higher education. The current academic findings, however, demonstrate that higher education is the level of education where individuals are able to attain environmental awareness. As an example, Sam et al. (2010) specified the importance of higher education specifically in the process of informing individuals on environmental matters, raising their consciousness and instituting permanent changes in behavior in this context in their study on students of a vocational college. However, it is striking that there are only a few studies and analyses conducted on the importance of environmental risk perceptions among students of post-secondary vocational schools at higher education level in Turkey. A part of the studies in relevant literature assessed the awareness of higher education students with respect to environmental issues and their environmental attitudes

HIGHER EDUCATION ON ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PERCEPTIONS

469

and environmental consciousness, while a lesser number of such studies identified the risk perception in environmental matters. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to identify whether environmental education created a difference in environmental risk perception and whether such differences, if any, contributed to the process of environmental protection in a meaningful manner. The study results are given below.
Students responding to the study stated that taking at least one course on environment during their university education had an impact on all aspects of their environmental risk perception. In contrast with Sam et al. (2010), the averages observed in the present study indicated that environmental education had the highest impact at the level of significance on the global risk perception. This result is consistent with the second hypothesis of the study and demonstrate that specifically the students attending the department on environmental and agricultural sciences were sensitive towards the impact of acid rain on forests, depletion of the ozone layer by the gases used in refrigerators, the increase in ultraviolet sunlight, and the leakage of toxic waste into rivers and soil. There are signals showing that the department aiming at educating qualified intermediate technical labour force required in the field of environmental protection and control in Turkey has achieved the intended level of environmental education through the current curriculum. The point that must be duly underlined in this context is the fact that students of other departments of the vocational college not linked directly with the environment also demonstrated a level of environmental risk perception. This result can be interpreted to imply that the college administration disseminated environmental consciousness throughout the school not only with formal education, but also through non-formal learning processes.
Finally, environmentally sensitive students were identified to be sensitive mostly towards global environmental risk factors. The great majority of students expressed that university education had improved their sensitivity towards environmental matters and they knew about the prominent non-governmental organizations active in the field of environment and became members to such organizations owing to their education.
In summary, the results of the present study indicate that the formal education and non-formal learning processes offered at vocational colleges with respect to matters concerning the environment have an impact upon students. The Vocational College of Technical Sciences under Akdeniz University in Turkey is among remarkable schools with both its number of students, departments, academic and administrative personnel, and its quality of education. The post-secondary vocational school that assumes important tasks in the education of intermediary labour force has been taking significant steps to raise environmental awareness of all students by providing education and training about “environment” to all students. In fact, the present study gives way to the opinion that the additions of courses on environmental matters to all departments create a difference in the environmental risk perceptions of students. The comparison of results through the use of the same question form at different vocational colleges in Turkey in further research studies is striking in terms of the efforts of vocational colleges to review their curricula. In the forthcoming research process, the plan is to reinterpret the results through the employment of qualitative research methods (interview, observation, etc.) and to identify whether students demonstrate environmental risk perceptions in different areas.

Strategic intelligence as an art and a science: creating and using conceptual frameworks
Itai Shapira
ABSTRACT
This article describes a major output of strategic intelligence: conceptual frameworks. Drawing on concepts from epistemology, ontology, and analytical methodology, it ﬁnds a philosophical foundation for conceptual frameworks in pragmatism and the ideas of Wittgenstein. Through the production and use of conceptual frameworks, strategic intelligence is revealed as both art and science, performing both creation and discovery. The use of such frameworks enables strategic intelligence to notice shifts as they begin to emerge. The article highlights Israeli theoretical perspectives, illustrates the practical utility of conceptual frameworks by applying them to Israeli cases, and suggests that using them contributes to strategy.
Introduction
Western scholars and practitioners of intelligence have produced a rich literature on many facets of their subject, from historical and organizational questions1 through methodology and tradecraft2 to current concerns such as big data3 and cyber.4 However, less attention has been paid to the theoretical underpinnings. True, many studies stress the need for a new theory5 – of intelligence, for intelligence or about intelligence;6 but few go beyond emphasizing the diﬃculties entailed even in deﬁning intelligence.7 This is true also with respect to strategic intelligence. While the subject itself receives much attention,8 the extant literature focuses on the relationship between intelligence and policy9 or strategy10 and on organizational issues,11 with less heed given to philosophical questions. And there is almost no research dedicated to the speciﬁc issue of conceptual frameworks in intelligence.
Within Israel, the theoretical discourse regarding intelligence remains scant, and based on outdated empirical data.12 Israeli experience in intelligence has been discussed in Western literature – especially in studies about the Yom Kippur War in 197313 and the revolution in Iran in 1979,14 and about the Israeli military intelligence acting de-facto as national intelligence.15 But there is little exploration of Israeli particular philosophical and methodological approaches. More generally, Israel’s intelligence culture seems to be an under-researched subject, perhaps reﬂecting a broader gap in studies of national intelligence cultures outside the Anglosphere.16
The present study attempts to bridge some of these gaps. I focus on strategic intelligence, drawing on concepts from epistemology,17 ontology, and analytical methodology to investigate its philosophical aspects, and highlighting conceptual frameworks as one of its main outputs. In addition, I draw on current strategic questions facing Israel, and engage with the works of several Israeli writers.18 Therefore, indirectly I highlight some aspects of Israel’s intelligence culture.
In terms of theory, this study extends the literature on strategic intelligence, illustrating the relevance of philosophy, and illuminating the role and foundations of conceptual frameworks. For these I ﬁnd a theoretical foundation in two philosophical schools – pragmatism, and the late philosophy of Wittgenstein.19 I show that the production and use of conceptual frameworks

illustrates the nature of strategic intelligence as both an art and a science, engaging in both creation and discovery. On the practical side, by analysing Israel’s strategic environment, the study shows how both intelligence and strategy personnel can beneﬁt from using conceptual frameworks. Like others, I attempt to illustrate the interaction between theory and practice.20
The paper proceeds as follows. I begin by describing the main characteristics of strategic
intelligence, and its dual character as a science and an art. I then describe the philosophical foundations and the pragmatic usefulness of conceptual frameworks. I give ﬂesh to my argument using Israeli strategic case studies. In conclusion, I point to the study’s limitations and suggest topics for further research.

What is strategic intelligence?
Sherman Kent, in 1949, described intelligence as having three facets: activity, knowledge and organization.21 This study is concerned with the former two – namely, the intelligence process and product – focusing on the analytical component of the ‘intelligence cycle’.22 Our speciﬁc focus is strategic intelligence, which is strategic in light of its object of analysis (the strategic environment, or
the strategic decision making echelon of enemies, rivals and friends); the process it is integrated in
(strategy); and the echelon that uses it (strategic). Let us distinguish between strategic and tactical intelligence,23 and between their outputs.24 Lanir
stressed that national intelligence – for this article’s purposes, strategic intelligence – is not just the ‘linear continuation’ of tactical intelligence.25 Hence it is relevant to remind here that the purpose of tactical intelligence is usually to reveal secrets hidden by the enemy26 The questions it engages are
ones for which answers exist, even if the enemy conceals them. It is concerned with matters that are physical, concrete, technological,27 or relatively universal in their patterns of behaviour.28 But strategic intelligence is diﬀerent.
From an ontological perspective, it is concerned with abstract and conceptual objects, albeit ones
linked to the physical objects that are the concern of tactical intelligence. For example, a shift in public conﬁdence in a political leader is an abstract phenomenon which may emerge because of tangible economic issues. The ontology of strategic phenomena is thus based on that of tactical
phenomena, without being a mere accumulation of the latter.
Strategic intelligence is also unique from an epistemological standpoint. For example: in order to develop knowledge about a state’s approach to the use of military force, or to deterrence – both objects of strategic intelligence – one must analyse cases in which force was used on the tactical level, or in which deterrence was manifested through tactical diplomatic engagements. The episte-
mology of strategic phenomena is thus dependent on that of tactical phenomena, but the latter is not suﬃcient for the former.
Tactical intelligence discovers objects rather than creates them. For strategic intelligence, the objects of discovery may be ‘strategic secrets’ – i.e. some strategic concept or idea that the enemy wishes to conceal. But these can also be ‘strategic mysteries or puzzles’: phenomena that are emerging, and for which no speciﬁc questions – let alone deﬁnitive answers – yet exist.29 Such phenomena might include, for example, trends in the socio-economic environment, or new political considerations that aﬀect strategic decisions. These also have an ontic basis, and the discovery aspect stems from the fact that their emergence creates a new strategic environment.
One of the traditional roles of strategic intelligence, based on tactical intelligence, is to provide early warnings of the enemy’s military actions. For Lanir these are ‘situational’,30 for Knorr they are ‘technical’,31 and for Betts they are ‘factual-technical’.32 Tactical intelligence about the enemy’s military capabilities and deployment is their core. But strategic intelligence adds a unique component. It needs to discover the abstract phenomena relating to concepts developed by the enemy’s decision maker, and also to discover emerging changes in the way the enemy perceives the environment.
At the same time, strategic intelligence involves creation – of a framework, or a theory, needed for understanding the strategic environment.33 Lanir, when discussing theories, distinguishes between

INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY

285

‘situational understanding’ (or analysis) and ‘basic understanding’,34 where the former deals with
military intelligence (for our purposes, tactical and operational intelligence), and the latter with
national intelligence. Situational understanding is based on inductive reasoning, in that conclusions
are derived from observations of patterns in collected data. In basic analysis reasoning is deductive, and information is tested in reference to theories. As such, it involves the ability to ‘think about
situations that have not yet materialized . . . The words intuition, sudden insight, creativity, imagination . . . we use them for purposes of theory’.35
Granit denies the exclusivity of what he calls the ‘realist paradigm’ – that is, the common wisdom that the aim of intelligence is to discover and understand entities and facts that exist ‘on the other side’.36 In Granit’s view, intelligence need not, and indeed cannot, infer the strategy of the other side by ‘get[ting] into the mind of the adversary’, in an objective manner that is detached from the ‘blue’
perspective. Granit, therefore, underlies creation over discovery. At this point it is helpful to consider four diﬀerent categories of strategic intelligence set forth by
Matza.37 The ﬁrst, ‘prophetic’ strategic intelligence, is concerned with predicting the future and providing an objective analysis of potential future development. The second, ‘strategic intelligence in an operational form’, is meant to support decision makers’ eﬀorts to shape the operational
environment and conduct a successful campaign. The third, which we can term politicized strategic intelligence, exists when intelligence is harnessed to justify the political echelon’s decisions and
actions already made. This approach contradicts the idea of intelligence as discovering objective truth. The fourth, ‘critical’ strategic intelligence, emphasizes critical analysis regarding the implications of the decision maker’s strategy.
What is, then, the main role of strategic intelligence? Is it intended to create knowledge about the future, namely foresight and prediction?38 The late Israeli President Shimon Peres claimed that ‘ . . . intelligence is responsible for information, that is, for everything that has happened in the past . . . .’39 Yet despite the limitations of induction based on past experience,40 this article maintains that strategic intelligence does need to assess potential future developments,41 mainly because the strategic deci-
sion-making echelon aims to shape the future. Therefore, an important goal of intelligence is reducing uncertainty.42 Another major role is noticing shifts as they emerge.43

Noticing shifts as they emerge
The main challenges in intelligence stem not only from mistaken analysis, but also mistaken identiﬁcation of the relevant intelligence object. Barnea draws a distinction between ‘focused surprises’, which are the product of a deliberate project of concealment by the enemy (e.g. the Yom Kippur War), and result from mistaken analysis, and ‘dispersed surprises’, which emerge in a spontaneous and unexpected manner (e.g. the Arab Spring), and result from mistaken focus of collection and analysis eﬀorts.44
Strategic surprises, as manifestations of intelligence failures, are heavily researched.45 Prominent experts maintain that they are inevitable,46 for both cognitive and organizational reasons.47 According
to the traditional view, a surprise is a consequence of a failure to notice the development of enemy military capabilities, or intentions to employ them. Wasserman critiqued this approach as reﬂecting the premise that intelligence knowledge is created inductively, based on past experience, through
observation (what he calls inductionism), or by relying on objective facts which are assume to have only one interpretation (naïve realism).48
Some surprises still stem from a decision being made ‘on the other side’ – e.g. state intervention through cyberattacks, to inﬂuence the outcomes of democratic elections;49 o r even emerging readiness for peace.50 But others do not necessarily result from deliberate decisions: socioeconomic issues,51 civilian uprisings,52 unintended escalations,53 and so on.
Timing is crucial to the success of early warning. Betts, using the term ‘doctrinal surprise’, argued that intelligence must be prepared to recognize emerging changes in enemies’ military concepts and doctrines – implicitly, in time to prevent surprises.54 And in order to notice shifts one must analyse

286

trends. Many analytical methods, such as ‘horizon scanning’,55 are relevant for this. The business world has been struggling for years with methods such as ‘weak signals’,56 ‘strategic issue management’,57 and ‘strategic issue diagnosis’,58 for adapting to changes in the competitive environment.59 Data science and technological forecasting also use analysis of anomalies as a tool for noticing shifts.60
Still, understanding trends and shifts is not enough. Strategic intelligence needs to be integrated
into the speciﬁc strategy in question. It does not and cannot be totally objective.

The objectivity of strategic intelligence
Intelligence based on the scientiﬁc approach must discover reality from an objective perspective. But from an artistic standpoint, intelligence becomes more subjective, and emphasizes creation, stem-
ming from the unique vantage point of the observer. Other approaches that stress creative and artistic aspects may even manifest a postmodernist and relativist line to intelligence.61 Granit
employs such an approach when discussing systemic intelligence, referencing similar ideas in systemic military thought and art.62 The systemic approach to intelligence emphasizes the creation of conceptual systems rather than objective discovery of reality. But according to Brun, ‘the problem begins when the occupation with conceptualization and with “subjective understanding” comes at the expense of an attempt to understand the complex reality’.63
The current study adopts an intermediate approach. It combines the realist paradigm with the
systemic approach, and hence it is positioned between objectivism and subjectivism. The criticalrealist philosophy also manifests a similar idea.64 Brun remarks that ‘the proponents of this approach are very aware of the possible biases both in producing the raw material and in processing it.
Therefore, they believe that the knowledge they possess constitutes hypotheses that are always susceptible to testing and criticism’.65
The issue of objectivity also has implications for the relationship between strategic-intelligence personnel and strategists.66 Jervis, for example, has explained why intelligence and policy people ‘clash’.67 In the US, where experiences such as the mistaken assessments of Iraq’s purported weapons of mass destruction in 2003, oﬃcials have become wary of the potential for the politicization of intelligence,68 and sometimes prefer to avoid oﬀering advice which might sound like policy.69 The phrase ‘speaking truth to power’ captures this attitude, describing the relationship between the intelligence oﬃcer (whose task is to discover truth) and the decision maker (who holds power).70 Simantov and Hershkowitz, like Kerbel and Olcott, recommend a cooperative approach, implicitly questioning some of the objective and therefore scientiﬁc elements of intelligence.71
There is, then, a need to look at how strategic intelligence is perceived and used by decision makers. Writing on this issue by decision makers in Israel is relatively sparse.72 But Hilsman’s 1950s description of how US leaders perceived intelligence73 still seems relevant. Most of the leaders
interviewed by Hilsman lacked a clear sense of the added value of intelligence for strategy. Intelligence products were described as lengthy, cumbersome, too academic, and insuﬃciently practical. The leaders complained that the intelligence they received failed to provide them with knowledge that was suﬃciently concrete and relevant to the speciﬁc strategic context – a problem that they ascribed, among other things, to intelligence oﬃcers’ lack of familiarity with strategic dilemmas as experienced by the leader himself. The leaders questioned the ability of intelligence researchers – most of whom were quite young – to understand and contribute to strategy, beyond the leaders’ own capacities gleaned from their long experience in strategy and their own contacts with foreign leaders. Some asserted that the knowledge required for strategic decision-making was
based mostly on open information, and that the national intelligence apparatus was no better at producing and analysing this information than were the leaders themselves.74
I argue that strategic intelligence indeed serves a useful and important role in providing back-
ground information for decision makers, as some of them might expect. But I see the a major
purpose of strategic intelligence in producing conceptual frameworks. This is one of its added values,
and it requires a combination of art and science.

INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY

Strategic intelligence: science and art combined
The subject of intelligence as art versus science has already been discussed in the literature.75 Brun76 sees intelligence as an ‘institution for clarifying reality’,77 and favours the scientiﬁc approach. Ben-Israel also emphasizes the scientiﬁc aspects.78 Johnston maintained that intelligence analysis should be seen as a scientiﬁc process.79 The tendency to favour the scientiﬁc method has been called ‘the myth of scientiﬁc methodology’.80 Some compare intelligence to ‘softer’ scientiﬁc disciplines, such as medicine.81 Yet, it is harder to ﬁnd studies pointing to similarities between strategic intelligence and art.82
When I refer to ‘science’, I mean primarily the scientiﬁc method – the use of observation and experience to test hypotheses and theories empirically,83 after breaking down the research question into sub-questions, for identifying objective causal connections and regularities.84 Ben-Israel describes this approach very thoroughly, referencing the philosopher Karl Popper.85 When I refer to ‘art’, I mainly mean subjective creation that is not susceptible to empirical validation or invalida-
tion, essentially holistic and created by intuition. Thus, for this study, the role of science is primarily
discovery, while the role of art is primarily creation. Viewing strategic intelligence as an art does not preclude the use of scientiﬁc practice and
techniques.86 It must still make use of qualitative methods87 from the social sciences and humanities, inductive in nature, such as grounded theory;88 or of quantitative methods from the natural sciences, deductive in nature.89 In recent years, social-science methodology has emphasized the constructivist approach,90 and this trend can also be of use.
For sure, tactical intelligence requires a strict scientiﬁc approach: it is based on information and observation (empirical ﬁndings), and uses structured analytical techniques.91 Reasoning can be deductive or inductive, but information has high value. The ontology must be primarily realist;92
that is, assuming that objects exist in reality and that intelligence can discover them. The epistemology must be mainly positivist;93 that is, assuming that the world is characterized by a regularity which the scientiﬁc method can discover, even when it comes to matters related to human decisions. The use of big data and artiﬁcial intelligence instruments can be especially relevant here.
But the more strategic is any intelligence, the greater the role of its artistic aspects, and thus of creativity. The ontological concept will be more idealist – it is the researcher who creates the objects of
interest through conceptualization and thought, or who discovers concepts and ideas that exist in reality,
but only in an abstract and not a physical manner. The epistemological approach will be more constructivist – the understanding of a strategic phenomenon is relevant only in the concrete context.94
The role of intelligence will be mainly to solve puzzles and mysteries. Reasoning will be both deductive and inductive, but in the main it will be abductive – producing a general explanation for a phenomenon that deviates from expectations.95 Raw information, therefore, will have a limited value.
Some have maintained that strategic analysis should even be seen as storytelling.96 Regardless, it
requires the synthetic (holistic) and intuitive observation and creation that characterize art, combined with the analytic and structured observation that characterizes science.97 Imagination, in that
sense, is a fundamental component of artistic and holistic approaches. In a demonstrative example,
the investigatory commission after the terror attacks of 11 September 2001, discussed the failure of imagination in the US intelligence community.98 The need for artistic aspects is evident because strategy itself contains holistic and artistic domains:99 it is designed not only to understand and conceptualize reality, but to change it.100 As such, in the world of security as in business,101 strategy
requires creativity.
In sum, there is no need to choose between science and art when discussing and practicing
strategic intelligence. Science can help us to understand and discover reality and causality, and to
notice patterns. Art can help us to see a holistic and complete picture, to notice shifts and deviations
from patterns, and to produce new forms for observation. Likewise, there is no need to choose
between induction and deduction in strategic intelligence. Rather, the two can be combined in abduction.102 Abduction can assist in creating conceptual frameworks.

Conceptual frameworks: one of the key products of strategic intelligence
Conceptual frameworks in the intelligence context can be thought of in terms of Kant’s notion of space and time as ‘a-priori concepts of consciousness’. These are the ‘lens’ through which we experience reality, which, according to Kant, is not accessible in itself.103
In strategic intelligence, the conceptual framework is the manifestation of the research question through which the analyst tries to give meaning to information. It does not necessarily reﬂect reality in an objective manner. Lanir put it well: ‘The question regarding the basic theory is not whether it is “true” or “false” at a certain point in time, but whether the research program based on it is advanced or productive – in the sense that it leads to new predictions’.104 Conceptual frameworks, then, should be regarded as an instrument for solving problems. The philosophy of pragmatism, which we will discuss next, also focuses on problem solving.105

Pragmatism and the late ideas of wittgenstein: relevant approaches for understanding conceptual frameworks
In this study I rely primarily on William James’s writings on pragmatism.106 This philosophical school opposes dualism between diﬀerent attributes of reality (spirit and matter) or diﬀerent forms of reasoning (empirical and conceptual).107 It criticizes the ‘correspondence theory’ of truth,108 according to which a sentence is true only if it exactly represents the reality it describes. Pragmatism asserts that there is a diﬀerence between claims and theories only if they produce a diﬀerence through their practical application. It scrutinizes claims in terms of their eﬀectiveness or relevance, and regarding their truth value: ‘Truth depends on its consequences’.109 James explains:
. . . [T]HAT IDEAS (WHICH THEMSELVES ARE BUT PARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE) BECOME TRUE JUST IN SO FAR AS THEY HELP US TO GET INTO SATISFACTORY RELATION WITH OTHER PARTS OF OUR EXPERIENCE, to summarize them and get about among them by conceptual short-cuts . . . . Any idea upon which we can ride, so to speak; and idea that will carry us prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, working securely, simplifying, saving labor. . . . 110
Pragmatism also ‘has no objections whatever to the realizing of abstractions, so long as you get about among particulars with their aid and they actually carry you somewhere’.111 I believe the resemblance with conceptual frameworks as a role of strategic intelligence is rather clear.
The late approach of Wittgenstein is also relevant. Wittgenstein maintained that a concept’s meaning is determined in light of the concrete context wherein it is used in language:
But what does it mean to say that we cannot deﬁne (that is, describe) these elements, but only name them? This might mean, for instance, that when in a limiting case a complex consists of only one square, its description is simply the name of the coloured square. Here we might say – though this easily leads to all kinds of philosophical superstition – that a sign ‘R’ or ‘B’, etc. may be sometimes a word and sometimes a proposition. But whether it ‘is a word or a proposition’ depends on the situation in which it is uttered or written.112
In order to see more clearly, here as in countless similar cases, we must focus on the details of what goes on; must look at them from close to.113
Wittgenstein explains that ‘ – When I give the description: “The ground was quite covered with plants” – do you want to say I don’t know what I am talking about until I can give a deﬁnition of a plant?’114 And elsewhere: ‘If I tell someone “Stand roughly here” – may not this explanation work perfectly?’115 Wittgenstein also describes ‘language games’,116 in the sense of similarities between diﬀerent practical manifestations of the same concept. Like the pragmatists, he emphasizes the practical use of theories, and praises vagueness for such needs. These ideas too resemble our notion of conceptual frameworks.
Now we can turn to practical Israeli test cases, in order to show how using conceptual frameworks realizes the ideas of pragmatism and Wittgenstein, and can enable producing better strategic intelligence and strategy.

Strategic intelligence in israel: examples for the use of conceptual frameworks
Some relevant Israeli cases might include:117 What outcomes are likely from the debates taking place in Iran in the aftermath of the US withdrawal from the nuclear agreement (JCPOA) during 2018? How is Hizballah likely to react after Israel carries out a strike in Lebanon against its precision-weapons project? Which of the various possible scenarios will emerge after Mahmoud Abbas leaves the Palestinian arena?
Let us begin by illustrating the value of information and of tactical intelligence for the production of strategic intelligence, using the question of how domestic struggles in Iran aﬀect its entrenchment in the Middle East. To address this question we must think how these struggles will aﬀect Russian, American, European, and Chinese policy. We must look at events and patterns in the military, diplomatic, economic, and political spheres. More deeply, understanding Iranian entrenchment in the Middle East requires analysing the issues over which the struggle in Iran is being waged. That, in turn, entails in-depth analysis of relations between the Supreme Leader, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and President Rouhani. These relations exist in reality and can be discovered, even if they are abstract; information about them can be obtained. Likewise, we must examine the military power of the IRGC, ties between IRGC and its proxies (Hizballah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen), and so on. All these also exist, and can be discovered. Some of them are the objects of tactical intelligence.
But we also need an artistic approach and even a ‘pragmatic imagination’.118 Only creative thinking, based on holistic principles, can produce the synthesis needed to transform these into a framework within which answers to the core question can begin to emerge.

‘The moderate sunni camp’
Let us take as a ﬁrst example the idea of a ‘moderate Sunni camp’. This refers to a group of Middle Eastern Sunni states that includes Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and to a
certain extent also Oman, Kuwait, and Morocco. Clearly there exists common ground among the
abovementioned states, and broadly speaking, potential exists for cooperation between Israel and some of them.119 Clearly there is also great variety.
The nature of this ‘moderate Sunni camp’, and whether it even exists, is a topic of discussion in Israel.120 But it seems that the question fails to grasp the nature of a conceptual framework. The camp does not exist the same way that Hizballah’s rockets or Iran’s nuclear facilities do. Its ontological basis is diﬀerent. The question of whether a Sunni camp exists depends primarily on what we mean by this concept. Hence, empirical data will not necessarily be of help in answering this question. Even if we notice collaborations between the Emirates and Egypt (e.g. on the Gaza issue);
even if we understand the common interests of Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, and Egypt in the crisis over Qatar;121 even if we observe how far Saudi Arabia and Egypt are prepared to go to reduce the Muslim Brotherhood’s inﬂuence – this is still not enough. It is more useful to ask how this framework can produce strategic intelligence and strategy.
Speciﬁcally, this framework facilitates examining the strategic culture of the Sunni states, and the eﬀectiveness of their means of inﬂuence. At least in the case of Saudi Arabia, these mainly consist of economic means. It can also help in formulating Israel’s position on the proposed US-sponsored Middle East Security Alliance (MESA).122 Therefore, it can facilitate clariﬁcation of Israeli policy towards the Sunni states. It can underscore the relative weakness of the Sunni states in inﬂuencing trends in the Middle East related to Iran,123 and the Sunnis’ lack of coherence compared to that of the Shiite actors.124

‘Strategic competitions’
A second example is the ‘strategic competitions’ in the Middle East. This is often used to describe the recent changes in the Middle East – in which Israel does not necessarily take a direct part, but which aﬀect it.125 A related concept is the ‘great-power competition’ between the US, China and Russia, a

290

I. SHAPIRA

concept – highly reminiscent of the Cold War period126 – which appears in the 2017 and 2018 summaries of the US National Security Strategy127 and its National Defense Strategy.128
In the Israeli context, the concept of ‘strategic competitions’ serves a useful purpose in framing struggles between Iran, the Sunni states, the United States, Russia, Turkey, and Israel itself – over inﬂuence, military power, and freedom of action (political and military). In Syria, for example, Israel is trying to counteract Iranian entrenchment and inﬂuence;129 the US sent forces to ﬁght the Islamic State (ISIS) but also to deter the Iranians and the Russians;130 the Russians are trying to deepen their
economic, political, and military inﬂuence; Turkey is seeking to create zones of inﬂuence, and so on.
But this conceptual framework too has more to do with a conceptualization projected onto reality
than with an objective discovery. Using empirical data to assess whether competition has intensiﬁed, or whether the situation of a given state has improved or worsened, is diﬃcult. How can we judge, for example, whether the competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran over inﬂuence in Lebanon has intensiﬁed? How should we assess whether the Russians or Iranians are winning the competition over Syria’s economic rehabilitation?
Speciﬁcally, the conceptual framework of strategic competitions allows Israel to weigh the merits and success of the IDF’s two-tier strategy of prevention and inﬂuence;131 and how it is helped by the US to contend with Iranian (and Russian) inﬂuence. The framework can guide Israel to decide which of the means at its disposal132 will be most eﬀective, and most in accord with Israeli strategic culture.133 More speciﬁcally, it makes clear that the Iranians and Russians possess more relevant and eﬀective means of inﬂuence in the Middle East than the Sunni states, and to some extent also than
the United States. This might be because Iran and Russia are willing to use direct military force along
with proxies, engage in information warfare in all its various aspects, make sophisticated use of
economic resources to generate inﬂuence, employ hard power for deterrence but also soft power to shape the preferences of third parties,134 while the Sunni countries and the US rely mainly on
economic and diplomatic means whose eﬀectiveness is limited. Furthermore, the US too is engaged in ‘great-power competitions’, outside the Middle East,
mainly with China and Russia.135 And whereas Israel sees the ‘campaign between the wars’ – i.e. ongoing low-grade military competition – as a key tool in its strategy of prevention and inﬂuence, and as a component of strategic competition,136 the US view of ‘grey-zone competition”137 is diﬀerent. The use of the ‘strategic competitions’ framework helps us to understand these diﬀerences.

Conclusion
In this study I sought to illustrate a potential philosophical basis for conceptual frameworks, and to show how implementing them in practice holds potential for improving strategic intelligence and strategy. I recommended that strategic intelligence be considered in light of pragmatism, and the late approaches of Wittgenstein. I drew from these philosophies three main ideas: (1) the role of theories, speciﬁcally of conceptual frameworks in intelligence analysis, is not necessarily to discover some objective truth or reality, but rather to help in solving concrete problems; (2) the meaning of concepts, speciﬁcally of conceptual frameworks, is created by how they are used in language and concrete contexts, not by universal deﬁnitions; and (3) strategic intelligence must take the middle path between empiricism and rationalism. I also argued that strategic intelligence is both an art and a science, its products being both creation and discovery. Creating conceptual frameworks, and then using them to discover unique phenomena and to identify shifts in trends as they begin to emerge, is a manifestation of this combined approach.
This study has several limitations. First, I did not explain in depth what I meant by ‘art’ and ‘science’ in the intelligence context. I only touched on the form of reasoning called abduction. While abduction strategies are sometimes discussed in relation to ﬁelds such as medicine and law,138 their relevance to intelligence needs further research. In addition, the present study does not fully answer the ‘so what?’ question: why and how does a philosophical discussion, and the use of conceptual frameworks, improve strategic intelligence and strategy?

Measuring the quality of intelligence is complicated. Scholars and former practitioners have struggled with this problem,139 and have mainly fallen back on the simplest and most straightforward measure, namely accuracy in prediction.140 I believe that is also a scientiﬁc way of looking at
intelligence. This article has called for a more balanced approach. Since conceptual frameworks are
not meant to discover or reveal a hidden reality, accuracy of forecasts cannot be their sole or even
main test. But what criteria should we use to assess whether we have indeed improved our strategic intelligence? I oﬀer the pragmatic principle as an initial answer.
I hope this study creates a desire to delve into the philosophical foundations of strategic
intelligence, just as writers in the business world have begun to integrate philosophical thought into business intelligence,141 management and organization.142 I also hope that it encourages
interaction between practitioners and theoreticians. Intelligence practice that lacks consideration of its epistemological, ontological, and methodological foundations143 is deﬁcient and partial, and may have diﬃculties coping with changes in the environment. Over recent years, intelligence communities both globally144 and in Israel145 have been discussing a ‘revolution in intelligence aﬀairs’ (RIA).146 This study recommends that theoreticians and practitioners engage in reﬂection147
and dialogue, which might serve as tools to generate this revolution.
This study might also contribute to bridging one of the gaps in intelligence studies set forth by Phythian – the need to establish a research agenda.148 In this respect, I explicitly recommend putting
more emphasis on methodological and philosophical concerns. Many studies have examined the inﬂuence of strategic intelligence on decision-making, with
pessimistic conclusions.149 Some argue that intelligence does not inﬂuence American foreign policy,150 being ‘drawn along’ by current and operational-level analysis.151 Some think that in the post-modern
era, strategic intelligence has lost its monopoly over many aspects of its added value to decision makers.152 Others maintain that the current challenges in the US153 and UK154 have more to do with
counterterrorism and operational issues than with strategic ones. The current study, naturally, has a diﬀerent view. This might be the worst of times, but also the best of times, for strategic intelligence.

Strategic intelligence is intended for use by the general staﬀ of the military, and deals with formulating and implementing defense and military strategy. Operational-level intelligence is intended for use by the general staﬀ and combatant headquarters, and deals with formulating operations for defeating a rival and reaching decisive victory. Tactical
intelligence is intended for use by air, land, sea and cyber forces, and deals with the actual employment of military power. In this article, I refer to both national- and strategic-level intelligence as ‘strategic intelligence.’ 27.

with Clients.” 72. For a rather unique example see Ya’alon, Intelligence from the Standpoint. 73. Hilsman, Strategic Intelligence. 74. It seems that intelligence always has to ‘compete’ with national leaders’ direct access to open information. See
Miller, “Open Source Intelligence,” 702–19. 75. Marrin, “Intelligence Analysis,” 529–45. 76. See note 63 above. 77. Brun turned my attention to the term ‘institution.’ It does not refer to the intelligence organization, but to the
orderly social mechanism within which the intelligence oﬃcer operates. 78. Ben-Israel, The Philosophy of Intelligence. 79. Johnston, Analytic Culture. 80. Cooper, Curing Analytical Pathologies. 81. Marrin and Clemente, “Improving Intelligence Analysis,” 707–29. 82. For an article which maintains that intelligence is an art and not a science see Denece, “Revolution in Intelligence
Aﬀairs,” 27–41. 83. Additional functions of science are to produce universal theories inductively, and to produce forecasts of the
future by using the same theories deductively. In the case of strategic intelligence, these roles are less relevant – and in general, in the social sciences and the humanities, which I view as domains strongly connected with intelligence research, the ability to produce forecasts about the future is relatively limited (because of the nature of human reality, which is not predictable). With regard to the distinction between the social sciences and exact
sciences, see: Berlin, Sense of Reality. In the context of the logical invalidity of induction see Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature.
84. Leibovitz and Agasi, Conversations About the Philosophy. 85. See note 78 above. 86. Such as ACH (analysis of competing hypotheses), which Brun refers to quite often. It was also mentioned in the
seminal work by Heuer, Psychology of Intelligence Analysis. 87. Walsh, “Improving Strategic Intelligence,” 548–62. 88. A well-known method in the social sciences for producing theories, though its scientiﬁc validity sometimes
comes under criticism. For a description of its relevance to intelligence, see Zohar, “Intelligence Analysis,” 130– 60.
89. An interesting example of the use of quantitative methods for military intelligence research can be found in Bang, “Pitfalls in Military Quantitative,” 49–73.
90. Charmaz, “Power of Constructivist,” 34–45. 91. Also see the way in which the US intelligence community deﬁned its method for using such techniques: Oﬃce of
the Director of National Intelligence, “Intelligence Community Directive 203.” 92. Lillbacka, “Realism, Constructivism and Intelligence Analysis,” 304–31. 93. Manjikian, “Positivism, Post-Positivism,” 563–82. 94. There were also those who pointed to the limitations of positivism with regard to strategic intelligence research,
but proposed an alternative that is not constructivist. Ben-Haim, “Positivism and its Limitations,” 904–17. 95. Abduction is sometimes related to the pragmatic philosophy. It does not receive much attention in intelligence
studies. In any case, on the diﬀerent methods of reasoning, see: Behfar and Okhuysen, “Perspective,” 323–40; Staat, “On Abduction, Deduction, Induction,” 225–37. 96. Trevetron, “Theory and Practice,” 475. 97. It is interesting to look into the etymological aspects of the word ‘analysis,’ which is based on the idea of disassembly. The opposite of analysis is indeed synthesis, or formation. Hence there is apparently a contradiction
between analytical research and holistic observation. For an interesting description of how phenomena are commonly perceived analytically in the West and holistically in the East, see Nisbett and Miyamoto, “Inﬂuence of Culture,” 467–73. 98. https://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf. 99. Brodie, “Strategy as an Art,” 26–38. 100. Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Introduction to ‘Operational Art’, 16. For a similar idea in the business context, see Hamel and Prahalad, “Competing for the Future.” 101. Brandenburger, “Strategy Needs Creativity,” 58–65. 102.

In my view, strategic analysis cannot provide answers similar
to those that tactical analysis does. Its importance lies, to a great extent, in the formulation and conceptualization of the questions themselves. Regardless, these issues were relevant at the time this article was written, during 2018. 118. Alexander, “Pragmatic Imagination,” 325–438. 119. Ya’alon and Friedman, “Historic Opportunity.” 120.

Nato at full stretch

The last two decades have been good for the Atlantic Alliance. Although the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991 removed the existential threat to NATO’s collective defence, and seemed for a while to challenge NATO’s very raison d’être, NATO found plenty of things to keep it busy. The collapse of Yugoslavia allowed the Organization to go out of area and invent new roles for itself in enforcing sanctions, supporting UN forces with its air power, carrying out airstrikes of its own and ultimately sending in peacekeeping forces to implement the settlements that ﬁnally emerged in Bosnia and Kosovo. Politically NATO was active too, turning former adversaries into partners through its Partnership for Peace programme. Many of them had their appetite whetted for more rather than less NATO and quickly expressed the aspiration to become full NATO members. Although this raised the hackles of Russia, it also gave NATO new found legitimacy as a central plank of the new European security order. Partners that did not seek to join NATO nonetheless joined its missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan or Libya and this too gave NATO new legitimacy outside Europe. It was hard for the United Nations to refuse to acknowledge an organization that was increasingly the expression, not only of its own 28 members but the broader international community.
In the military sphere too, NATO was unchallenged. The adversaries of the ﬁrst two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall could not defy for long NATO’s conventional superiority, whether from the air or on the ground. Using asymmetric tactics, like Milosevic did by putting his tanks next to schools in Kosovo or the Taliban planting roadside bombs in Afghanistan, might frustrate NATO tactically, but they could not challenge NATO’s domination of the strategic space. Lacking high-tech and sophisticated weaponry, they could not contest the battleﬁeld as long as the Allies had the political will to see these missions through.

Looking back at the history of the last two decades from a NATO perspective, what appears decisive to the Alliance’s successes or failures was the willingness of NATO Allies to stick together, to apply their power and leverage the contributions of others, rather than the strength of the opponents that the Alliance was up against. Put crudely, only NATO could defeat NATO. Consequently, a quick air campaign or the dispatch of a limited number of troops to a distant theatre of operations were usually sufﬁcient to turn the situation around and buttress those local political actors most sympathetic to NATO’s interests and values.
This relatively benign situation has now changed and, unfortunately, very much for the worse. NATO is no longer operating in an uncontested environment. As the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London has pointed out, the West is losing its technological edge as Asia spends US$100 billion more than Europe on defence and drones, cyber capabilities, robotics, artiﬁcial intelligence and advanced weaponry became accessible to more and more states and non-state actors like Hezbollah or ISIL alike. The challenges which NATO has to address are also structural, which means that their origins are deep-rooted and complex and can not be ameliorated with a quick air campaign or the despatch of a few brigades. Indeed, notwithstanding any action that NATO could take – even optimal, the strategic context that NATO faces both in Europe and beyond is likely to get worse before it gets better. It will take decades before the Allies can hope to return to the more benign environment of just 5 years ago and the cost of maintaining relative peace and stability is going to be much higher for the Allies in the future that at any time since the early 1980s. There are no quick ﬁxes; no relying on someone else to provide one’s security; and no more reliance on the instruments of soft power, such as diplomacy or development aid, as a substitute for investing

in hard power and signiﬁcant military forces. As Allies realize that the Russian annexation of Crimea and its incursion into Eastern Ukraine were not a bad dream but a reality which is here to stay, or that the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq is rapidly spreading across North Africa and the Middle East, the task is not to maintain an existing status-quo but build a new security architecture for Europe from the ground up. An order that not only prevents European integration from unravelling but which can also better protect NATO’s remaining democratic partners like Ukraine, Georgia or Jordan, to the east and south. So an Alliance that has already been around for 67 years today faces challenges, which are perhaps not as existential as during the Cold War but which are certainly more complex and intractable.
To the east, Russia’s incursions into Ukraine would be worrying enough if they were only a singular violation of international law. But they are also part of a pattern of increasing military assertiveness by Russia that we already witnessed against Georgia in 2008 and when Russia insisted on stationing its forces beyond its borders in places like Moldova, Belarus and Armenia. When a great power sees more beneﬁt in breaking the rules rather than enforcing them, you know you are in trouble. Indeed, the theme that Putin introduced at the Valdai conference 3 years ago was ‘new rules or no rules’, which suggested that Russia had made a decision to turn away from the West and try to establish its own, competitive security order in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. But this is not just about noninterference in each other’s claimed spaces or spheres of inﬂuence. Russia is also clearly seeking to expand its inﬂuence on the European Union (EU), on the Baltic States and NATO’s other Eastern Allies and wean them away from Brussels through a combination of economic carrots and security sticks. It is sending its ships into NATO waters and provoking NATO in its own airspace. Its regular and unannounced snap exercises in the High North, in the Baltic and Black Seas, and close to NATO’s borders are designed to intimidate the Allies by demonstrating how quickly and easily Russia can amass power and launch an offensive before the Allies have had time to fully analyse the situation or agree on a response. At the same time, Russia is militarizing Kaliningrad and Crimea, installing so-called anti-access aerial denial capabilities, such as sophisticated S-300 and S-400 air defence systems, antiship missiles, and electronic warfare and jamming equipment. This suggests an intention to create a bubble around NATO’s eastern most members, which would make it difﬁcult and dangerous for NATO to reinforce those Allies from the sea, the land or the air. In short, an Alliance which puts a premium on order, predictability and transparency, is confronted by a Russia that seems to thrive on uncertainty and the continuous production of anxiety among its neighbours, opening new fronts while the frozen conﬂicts of

Moldova, Eastern Ukraine, Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia are left to fester for generations. A telling moment occurred at the recent Munich Security conference, when the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov asked: ‘What part of Europe belongs to Russia?’ His Polish counterpart replied that the European space of Russia is Russia, not less but not more. Lavrov clearly seemed dissatisﬁed with this reply.
The one saving grace of the re-assertion of Russia is that NATO is at least dealing with a single country – no matter how vast and powerful – and a limited group of political actors, the ‘Sviloki’ clustered around Putin in the Kremlin. So it is feasible to negotiate with Putin and even to exploit common interests, as the West found recently in securing the nuclear deal with Iran, a ceaseﬁre and delivery of humanitarian aid in Syria and the UN Resolution condemning North Korea for its fourth nuclear test and missile launches. Putin can theoretically wake up tomorrow morning and decide that he wants to change course and return to cooperation; in which case the structures to do so are still in place. The NATO-Russia Council can resume its regular meetings, all of the various practical cooperation activities in areas like terrorism or arms control can be resumed. Russia and NATO can go back to talking on how to deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan, and treaties on transparency and risk reduction like the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, Open Skies or the Vienna Document 2, can all be resuscitated. What US Secretary of State John Kerry calls the ‘off ramp’ is still potentially in place, if Putin wants to take it. Unlikely in the present circumstances; but theoretically possible. If Russia chooses to continue its course of military confrontation with NATO in Eastern Europe, then at least the geographical zone of engagement is clearly deﬁned and NATO still has a great deal of military power with which to deter Russia or uphold its collective defence in the most extreme circumstances.
In the south, by contrast, the geographical area runs to millions of square kilometres. From the Sahel in West Africa all along the North African littoral and throughout the Middle East, right the way up to the Caucasus. We are dealing with four civil wars – in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen – and those states which still have a basis of governance and stability are increasingly being contaminated and undermined by the blow back of these wars spilling on to their territories. Recently, the Islamic State carried out its second major operation in Tunisia, this time at Ben Guerdane. Both Egypt and Israel are threatened by the emergence of Jihadist groups in the Sinai. Iran has stirred up the Houthi insurrection against Yemen, which has drawn in Saudi Arabia and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. A quarter of the population of Lebanon are now Syrian refugees and the second largest city in Jordan is currently a refugee camp. Meanwhile, Turkey has had to spend $10 billion hosting 3 million Syrian and other

refugees, the largest proportion in the world. A few years ago, the Head of US CENTCOM, General David Petraeus, used to say that if the Arab-Israeli conﬂict over Palestine could be resolved, the Middle East would be a much more stable area, receptive to American inﬂuence. If today that intractable issue were to be resolved (which admittedly is unlikely), its impact on all the turmoil and violence across the Middle East would be relatively small and more of a long-term gain than an immediate game changer. Unlike in Europe in the 1990s, where the contamination of inﬂuence across state boundaries was largely positive in the direction of democracy, the free market economy and dispute resolution, the trend today is in the opposite direction, with failed or failing states dragging others down into the vortex.
Recent statistics from the World Bank tell a grim story. In Syria alone, the Bank estimates that it will take $170 billion for reconstruction and 20 years at a minimum for Syria to regain its 2010 GDP level. In Iraq, more than three million people have become internally displaced as part of Iraq’s territory has been captured by the Islamic State. Poverty in Iraq reached 22.5 per cent of the population in 2014 and is as high as 40 per cent among displaced persons. A dramatic increase in poverty and malnutrition has also been registered in Yemen where 80 per cent of the population is now considered poor. In Syria and Iraq, per capita income is roughly a quarter less than what it might have been had the conﬂicts in these two countries not occurred. The current situation makes it impossible to predict the future political shape of the Middle East. What we know at least for certain is that the Arab nationalist state model has failed; the emergence of Islamist caliphates is too nightmarish to be contemplated; if existing borders are to be preserved, then there will have to be much greater decentralization and federalization of powers for groups such as Kurds, Sunnis or Alawites, and for some considerable time to come, no single actor, either pro-western or anti-western, will be strong enough to impose order unilaterally. Whereas Europe can still hope to go back to how it used to be, this vision is impossible in the Middle East; but the longer it takes the international community to stop the ﬁghting, the more fragmented this region will become, with the result that any new order is not likely to last very long.
Facing threats from the east and the south is a new situation for the Atlantic Alliance. Over the last two decades, NATO has been in the fortunate position of needing to face only one challenge in one location at a time. The Soviet Union had disappeared by the time NATO was called on to intervene in the Balkans. It was easy to take equipment to Afghanistan when this did not leave any vulnerable open spaces along the Fulda Gap in Germany. As deployments in Bosnia, Kosovo or Afghanistan went on for several years, the Allies had plenty of time to analyse the situation, take their decisions in a very deliberate and step-by-step manner, and prepare their forces for periodic rotations.

As these missions were often more important for some Allies than for others, it was relatively easy for the latter to demonstrate solidarity by making only token or even symbolic contributions, such as a few ofﬁcers in a headquarters, rather than a whole battalion in a hot spot like Mitrovica or Helmand province. Today, by contrast, the challenges are too severe and too close to home, to enable free-riding or to waste scarce resources. Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University has estimated the costs of Afghanistan and Iraq at over four trillion dollars and rising. Arguably, this money would be much better spent today facing up to Russia in the east or helping to pacify the conﬂicts of the Middle East and to crush the Islamic State. But money can not be spent twice and the Alliance will have to adapt to the new security environment with Europeans now spending on average 1.1 per cent of their GDP on their armed forces. Commendably, at its last Summit in Wales, the Alliance established a benchmark of 2 per cent GDP for defence that all Allies agreed to meet over the next decade. But only ﬁve Allies have today met this target (naturally one being the United States) and this is depriving NATO of potentially $90 billion a year of extra money to improve its defences. It is true that 16 Allies over the last 2 years have published plans to gradually increase their defence spending but it will take a long time before the 2 per cent benchmark becomes the norm rather than the exception. Donald Rumsfeld famously said that ‘you ﬁght with the army you have, rather than the one you would like to have’. In a similar vein, a NATO at full stretch to meet the challenges from the east and from the south will need to dramatically cut down on inefﬁciencies and ﬁnd ways to get much better value – both for deterrence and defence – out of the forces it already has. This will make projects like Smart Defence (coined by NATO’s former Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen to promote more defence multi-national programmes among Allies and more pooling and sharing of expensive equipment such as transport aircraft and observation drones) all the more necessary.
At least on the eastern front, NATO has got off to a determined, even decisive, start. The Readiness Action Plan approved at the Wales Summit provided for immediate assurance measures to show NATO’s determination to defend its member states and reassure the nervous Eastern European Allies. The key was to have all 28 Allies participate in these short-term deployments and exercises to communicate solidarity. But forces designed for assurance are not necessarily good for combat, as they are too small and too light. So the second phase of the Readiness Action Plan is the longer-term adaptation of NATO’s military posture in the east. This will be the theme of the next NATO Summit in Warsaw in July, but the outlines are already clear. NATO has stood up a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force that can be sent to the Baltic states or Poland in just over 48 hours. This is backed up by an

enhanced NATO Response Force of up to 40 000 troops. Eight NATO Force Integration Units or mini headquarters are being set up on the territories of Eastern Allies and NATO is devising a number of capability packages to ensure that it has the strategic lift, the funding for training and exercises and storage sites and staging areas, and the command, control and communications to be able to deploy these High Readiness forces to their forward positions in a crisis situation. Graduated response plans are also being developed for the defence of Poland and the Baltic States and later Romania and Bulgaria. So far, so good. The old complaint of former Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski that ‘Poland has been in NATO for 15 years and all it has to show for it is a virtual training centre in Bydgoszcz’ no longer rings true. Notwithstanding NATO’s pledge to Russia back in 1997 not to deploy substantial combat forces in Eastern Europe in normal circumstances, the security vacuum on the territory of the new member states is rapidly being ﬁlled. NATO is also stepping up the momentum of its exercise programme, to make sure that these reinforcement plans not only look good on paper but can actually be carried out swiftly. The Trident Juncture Exercise in Spain, Portugal and Italy last November ran to nearly 36 000 troops and was the largest combined forces manoeuver that NATO had carried out since the end of the Cold War.
Yet, as Alliance leaders head to Warsaw, there are some difﬁcult issues they still need to grapple with if the Readiness Action Plan is to be fully ﬁt for purpose.
One is the balance between pre-positioned forces in the east with their supplies and heavy equipment and other forces on standby in Western Europe to be used for reinforcements. Given the speed with which Russia is able to mass force on their borders, the eastern Allies are clearly nervous about relying on reinforcements alone. Along the lines of the Cold War posture, albeit with greatly reduced numbers, they would prefer a number of armoured brigades to be permanently on their territories to enhance deterrence but also to be able to hold back a Russian advance long enough to allow reinforcements to arrive. The Allies have already accepted much of this logic and the United States recently announced a new look European Reassurance initiative which quadruples its budget to $3.4 billion to ﬁnance the persistent presence of one US heavy combat brigade with logistics in the east, together with the requisite rotation and training and exercises. The United States will be looking for the European Allies to make an equivalent contribution so that this persistent presence is truly multinational and not a ﬁg leaf for a largely American responsibility. Many Western European Allies, on the other hand, would not like this persistent presence to become so expensive or static that it undermines their ability to use their forces for other contingencies, for instance in North Africa or the Gulf, and given that the threats from the south

often seem more real and imminent in their eyes than the hypothesis of a Russian aggression. So they would like to preserve maximum ﬂexibility. They also worry that too large a heavy NATO presence in the east would provoke Russia and make a de-escalation from current tensions more difﬁcult.
In the long-term, the solution to this problem has to lie in a certain degree of generosity whereby the eastern Allies reciprocate for the contribution on their territories of other Allies by sending more of their own forces to the south. France has shown the way by sending its aircraft, ships and reaction forces on exercises in the east, notwithstanding its commitments in Mali and the Central African Republic and the anti-Isil Coalition in Iraq and Syria. Poland, after hearing about the new US investments in its own defence, agreed to dispatch trainers and F-16 aircraft to the anti-Isil Coalition in Iraq. This principle of mutual generosity has to become much more generalized if the Readiness Action Plan is to be sustained in the long term and arguments over the prioritization of scarce assets such as theatre ballistic missile defence systems or aircraft and helicopters are to be avoided. A related question is for NATO to try to develop a better grasp not just of what will fully reassure its eastern Allies that they are effectively defended, but what will deter Russia. How can we know that Russia is deterred? And could this be with fewer forces than are actually required for a credible defence in the worst case scenarios? The Rand Corporation recently produced a study suggesting that effective deterrence and defence in the east would necessitate the forward deployment of seven to eight heavy brigades, which is a long way from the four battalions, backed by reassurance forces and the timely deployment of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force that NATO is currently proposing. So achieving an effective balance between pre-positioning and reinforcement, in a way that balances the military and political interests of the Alliance for both defence and dialogue with Russia and eastern versus southern requirements will be the ﬁrst test for the Warsaw Summit.
A related challenge is the coordination of initial High Readiness forces with follow-on forces for a more protracted conﬂict. It is not much use getting a battalion to Latvia in 48 hours if the back-up brigade or division takes more than 30 days to call up and another 2–3 weeks to transport to the theatre of operations. Harbours, airﬁelds and rail-heads in Eastern Europe have to have the required capacity for reinforcement. Bridges need to support movement by tanks. NATO forces have not been used in larger formations, such as divisions, for force-on-force ﬁghting for several years and NATO’s slimmed down command structure may be too small to both generate all the extra forces needed in a crisis and conduct complex battles at the same time. There is the challenge of interoperability at the brigade level. The logistics of mass deployment are also more complicated today than they were during the

Cold War, when there were 326 000 US troops permanently stationed in Europe, shorter distances to cover and far more bases, infrastructure, stocks and fuel pipelines to keep the tanks rolling. Today, by contrast, 95 per cent of military supplies are moved by the private sector, which also provides 75 per cent of host nation support in country. The IT systems, cyber band width, ports, railways, pipelines, grids and airspace that NATO relies on to deploy and sustain its forces used to be controlled by governments with civil-military planning boards and wartime equivalent powers to switch to military use. But these have become obsolete and privatization and the proﬁt motive have removed the back-up and redundancies that made this critical infrastructure resilient. The Readiness Action Plan has uncovered the need for 88 legal agreements among Allies to convey forces and equipment across borders. So NATO’s leaders will need to ensure that if deterrence fails, the Alliance is able to respond, not only quickly, but sustain the longer conﬂict that may be needed to evict all hostile forces from its territory. And for this, it will need to be able to call on rapidly, and if necessary, the combat capable brigades in its force structure that are not included in the VJTF or NRF at any given time.
A third element for Warsaw is to commission a strategy to deal with the A2/AD problem. As the Readiness Action Plan relies upon all reinforcements arriving on time, NATO needs to neutralize this bubble or at least ﬁnd a way through it, including the much discussed Suwalki Gap between Poland and Lithuania. The challenge is not insuperable. Like all the challenges mentioned in this article, NATO Allies have the brain-power, know-how and technological ﬁxes to deal with it comprehensively, provided they summon the forces, energy and political will. But the A2/AD challenge will oblige the Alliance to plug wellknown shortfalls in stealth aircraft, drones, decoys, surveillance and target intelligence, suppression of air defence weapons, precision-guided weapons, jammers and even reexamine the role of active cyber capabilities, which nations could make available to SACEUR should he require cyber effects. In this connection, the Alliance’s access to these largely US capabilities will prove decisive. More broadly, NATO needs an innovation strategy in an age when Google spends four times more on research and development than the US Defence Advanced Projects Research Agency. Innovation is not only about identifying the game changing new technologies but also making better use of existing technologies through improved training, processes, tactics and organization. This is how Germany defeated France in 1940 even though its Panzer tanks were inferior in number and quality to those of the French. The Germans simply experimented more to deﬁne an optimal plan that maximized both their own strength and vulnerabilities of their opponents. Similarly, NATO’s exercises need to do more than merely demonstrate resolve. They must rehearse the

Graduated Response plans along a ‘train as you ﬁght’ mode and focus not just on how to get NATO’s forces to the Baltic states but what they will do to make an impact when they arrive; for instance, in integrating with local forces, the NATO assurance forces already in theatre and other Allied forces coming initially under national command.
Finally, a strategy for the east has to focus on the most probable and not just on the worst case scenarios. Given the risks involved in launching a conventional aggression against NATO, Russia is more likely to engage in hybrid warfare tactics to mask aggression behind confusion, propaganda, sabotage actions and fomenting social or ethnic unrest. The aim of hybrid operations is to undermine and intimidate an adversary while staying below the Article 5 Collective Defence threshold which will make it more difﬁcult for the Allies to come to a common assessment and respond quickly. Having studied the phenomenon of the ‘little green men’ in Crimea and Russian inspired attacks on Ukraine’s telecommunications networks and electricity grid, NATO has developed a hybrid warfare strategy. It advocates more crisis management exercises to test and reﬁne crisis response options, accelerated decision-making procedures and, above all, a reform of intelligence to improve NATO’s situational awareness and ability to distinguish between random events and a fully orchestrated hybrid campaign. The more successful hybrid warfare is for Russia, the more the Kremlin might be tempted to exploit its probes by the selective introduction of fake ‘humanitarian convoys’, Special Forces or entire military units as in the Donbas. So a swift and effective response to hybrid actions is essential to prevent escalation. But given the multiplicity of potential hybrid targets, for instance the cyber domain, critical infrastructure or the nexus of media, ethnic minority politics and populism, this is not something NATO can do by itself. The EU has a much larger responsibility than NATO for homeland security and national resilience. It can see a part of the hybrid spectrum that NATO can not and so combining forces is the most sensible approach. By increasing contacts in cyber security, situational awareness and forecasting, countering propaganda and civilian–military coordination, NATO and the EU are developing compatible playbooks to handle various hybrid scenarios. Joint exercises and a joint analysis cell are two ways for the two Organizations to test their responsiveness. A joint declaration on hybrid by the NATO Secretary General and the EU High Representative is one of the Alliance’s ambitions for the Warsaw Summit. An additional beneﬁt is that hybrid can bring NATO and the EU closer on other issues as well, such as Libya, defence capacity-building in North Africa and the Middle East or combatting migrant trafﬁcking in the Aegean.
When it comes to Collective Defence in the east, NATO has to balance strictly military defence with the resilience of its own political structures and economies; but it also

needs to balance its own resilience with that of its partners to the East. The fragile democracies of Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova are now NATO’s ﬁrst line of defence. The more resilient they are to Russia’s pressures, the less likely Russian military intimidation or hybrid attacks will work against NATO. So assisting these partners with security sector reform, training, exercises and capacitybuilding is not an option but a necessity, as is keeping the perspective of NATO membership open to these countries, even if not a near term prospect. Given the state of governance and absorption capacity in these countries, building effective defence forces can be a lengthy and frustrating affair. The pitfall is often to count activities rather than measure results and assistance can suffer from too many individual, duplicating efforts rather than a coherent overall strategy. Yet as much as NATO focuses on the Readiness Action Plan for its own members, it has to stay equally engaged and for the long run with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova. We have to break from a tradition of ‘we pretend to reform and you pretend to help us’. NATO at Warsaw could signal its willingness to help by opening training centres in Ukraine and Moldova, similar to the one it has already set up in Georgia.
All this may seem complicated enough, but it is simplicity itself when compared with the challenges of the south. Here the Alliance can not go it alone but needs stronger partnerships with the still functioning states of the region. Libya has shown how the UN, EU or NATO can be hampered in their efforts to assist a country with projects such as border control, training or institution building when they lack the trust of, or can not communicate adequately with the local authorities. NATO’s existing partnership mechanisms vis-à-vis the south (the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative) have not been active since the Arab Spring. Partners often prefer bilateral relations with the Alliance, or to use existing regional cooperation mechanisms such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Arab League or the African Union. They often look more for concrete assistance, such as equipment transfers (where NATO is dependent on what its member states are prepared to contribute ﬁnancially and materially) than for political dialogue. Consequently the Alliance’s ﬁrst task vis-à-vis the south is to conclude stronger bilateral agreements with the regions established security frameworks. The Gulf Cooperation Council, for instance, is now establishing its own command and control, joint headquarters and a maritime coordination centre in Bahrain. At the same time, NATO needs to engage not only with Jordan, which is the only ‘Enhanced Opportunity Partner’ of the Alliance in the region, but also with other key players such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco and Algeria. NATO Special Envoys could help to nurture these ties in the same way they have done in the Caucasus (Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan).

NATO’s current regional priority is defence capacitybuilding. Individual programmes have been concluded with Jordan and Iraq and some of NATO’s experience of training local forces in Afghanistan (for instance in countering improvised explosive devices or improving helicopter and aircraft survivability against MANPADs) can be put to good use in North Africa and the Middle East as well. Yet to be effective, NATO will have to put far more resources into these programmes and perhaps consider setting up a military training command for the region to avoid having to set up a new programme for every new country and to have a better oversight of the effort and ability to shift resources quickly from one location to another. This was the theme of a speech given by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in Washington last April. The other issue concerns the already mentioned need for stronger cooperation with the EU, which is running programmes of its own, particularly in Mali and the Central African Republic, as part of the Common Defence and Security Policy. Again, NATO and the EU have complementary assets, with the EU focusing more on police, judiciary and border security and NATO being better suited to the training of standing military forces. So a pragmatic division of labour would make sense and Libya, where both NATO and the EU have pledged to help once a national unity government is formed, would be an early test case to see whether this is possible. The fact that NATO and the EU border management organization FRONTEX are now cooperating closely in the Aegean to curb the illegal trafﬁcking of migrants, does bode well for the future; and NATO’s maritime mission in the Mediterranean (Active Endeavour) could cooperate more with the EU Sophia Task Force off the coast of Libya, once NATO Ambassadors have switched it from an Article 5 Collective Defence operation (ongoing since the 9/11 terrorist attacks) to a more generic crisis management operation. Pooling intelligence-gathering, coordinating patrols and generating maritime assets collectively, would also be the best way to proceed.
Although the south may well prove to be more of a long drawn out affair than collective defence in the east, and the Alliance will have to learn by trial and error, NATO does have assets that could make it a highly relevant actor. The extensive network of partnerships in the Mediterranean Dialogue and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative have been mentioned, even if these need to be revitalized. The Alliance has also been cooperating closely with the African Union and has provided strategic lift for African Union forces into Darfur and Somalia, as well as the development of the African Union Standby Force. NATO-UN cooperation is now at an all-time high and the UN is reaching out for training and expertise in areas such as countering improvised explosive devices, where NATO has a keen interest to be helpful. The UN is assuming a large part of its peacekeeping effort in Africa, and the cost of UN blue

helmets is only about a quarter of that of a NATO force. Looking further ahead is the issue of whether NATO should join the International Coalition against ISIL in Iraq and Syria, providing more support or coordination (particularly in the coordination of the air campaign) and beyond the current focus on the defence of the NATO Ally, Turkey. The key challenge in the south will be to keep this region essentially an issue of defence capacity-building and partnership. What NATO needs to avoid at all costs is the emergence of actors in the south (such as an ISIL equipped with ballistic missiles or biological or chemical capabilities) that could actually pose a territorial threat to NATO’s southern Allies. For this would require a much larger focus on military structures in the southern region and forward deployed forces than is currently foreseen in the Readiness Action Plan and the establishment of a multinational divisional headquarters in Romania.
In conclusion, the years ahead will be both intense and challenging for the Alliance. Four things will determine whether NATO succeeds in being as successful in the new security environment as it has been in all the previous ones that it has faced up to:
The ﬁrst: closer cooperation with the EU and a more systematic pooling of assets and programmes has already been mentioned. For this reason, NATO and the EU must not miss the rendez-vous with hybrid warfare, Libya and the migration issue in the Mediterranean.
The second: to make use of NATO’s partnerships. The current focus on drawing closer to Finland and Sweden is obvious and understandable, given that these two Nordic partners have been close to the Alliance and share a common preoccupation with Russia’s behaviour in the Baltic region. Indeed, the implementation of the Readiness Action Plan in the east would be difﬁcult without the active engagement of Finland and Sweden in crisis consultations and NATO’s military defence planning. This said, other key partners, such as Australia, Japan or New Zealand, should not be neglected. They may not be as concerned by the situation in Eastern Europe but they are worried about the deterioration in the Middle East and the growing threat of terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, not to mention cyber attacks, the maritime sea lanes of communication or critical infrastructure protection. So NATO will have to be creative in ﬁnding new ways to engage these so-called global partners as operations in Afghanistan wind down.
A third point concerns capability and innovation in the Alliance. It is obvious that if NATO is to meet all its military challenges, its armed forces need to be much better organized to achieve better value for money. The idea of organizing nations into capability clusters is not a new one; but it needs to be pursued more vigorously. Germany is

leading the way by establishing a Framework Nation concept. Currently it brings together 16 Allies to develop 17 distinct capabilities, including the generation of follow-on formations for the Readiness Action Plan. A Transatlantic Capability Enhancement and Training initiative is currently bringing the United States and Europeans together, to assist Poland and the Baltic states. These are good initiatives that need to be pursued. Allies need sound defence planning and to free up more room in their budgets for modernization and training. Many Allies are starting from a very low base, after years of insufﬁcient defence spending and so the current improvements in defence budgets have to be sustained for the long run. What NATO can do to help in this regard is to deﬁne clearly which capabilities can be procured through NATO common funding and better NATO capability planning and which should be apportioned to individual Allies through the NATO defence planning process.
A ﬁnal reﬂection concerns the balance between military and political instruments of power. NATO’s success has always depended on achieving the right balance between military and diplomatic efforts to counter and ultimately remove threats. As NATO goes back to being a hard core military organization, with a focus on capability, it also needs to focus more on arms control, the reinforcement of international norms and diplomacy. The more dangerous nuclear weapons become, the more you need agreements such as START and President Obama’s Nuclear Safety initiative. The more tanks come back to Central Europe, the more you need risk reduction, transparency and veriﬁcation instruments with Russia. The more cyber goes offensive, the more there is a need for conﬁdence-building norms in the cyber domain, such as the ones the United States has recently achieved with China and Russia. As NATO sharpens its military edge, it also has to be alert for possibilities for de-escalation and dialogue and to read correctly the signals that may come from Moscow or other places in the future. Being seen to support diplomacy and international norms will also help NATO carry the rest of the world with it as it navigates this new dark period in European security with the hope, as during the ﬁrst Cold War half a century ago, that deterrence and a vigilant border defence will not become a permanent state of affairs but a temporary interlude before the return of brighter and happier times.

RUSSIAN NARATIVE OF INTERVENTION IN SYRIAN CIVIL WAR Critical examination of the Russian discourse

2016

Abstract This thesis critically examines the Russian military intervention in Syria during
the period of September 2015 – March 2016. It is a study that contributes to the analysis of the interrelation of two areas of political studies: media studies and foreign policy. In order to describe the logic behind Russian participation in the Syrian conflict, a social constructivist reading is suggested; according to which, the way the discourse of the Russian intervention has been presented in Russian media indicates the primary role of specific understanding of the ethical goals of Russian foreign policy. Specifically, the Russian military intervention in Syria is driven, according to the Russian discourse, by the need to present itself to the world as a “good actor” through a “just war.”
Applying the method of qualitative discourse analysis, the thesis deconstructs the Russian narrative of intervention in the Syrian civil war through the Russian perspective. The results indicate the particular importance of the social function of war in Russian foreign policy – the importance of its performative and communicative aspect. Moreover, the result is a perceived conflict between two logics of understanding of the International – transcendental and local-centered – is revealed as a potential driving force of the modern tensions in the relationship between Russian and the West.
As a result, a key problem in said relationship is the problem of communication: the lack of language both parties would understand. Without such a language, the actions of the opponent are continually interpreted, not from the perspective of the partner, but from the perspective of the viewer, which in the case of Russian-West discourse results in accusations of dishonesty and hypocrisy.
Finally, the research highlights how the discourse of Syrian intervention is constructed and reflects the social function of war in Russia in general. This function of a “just war” (and any war in Russia is ‘just’ by default) is to serve as the moral cornerstone of the country’s identity, as the mechanism of consolidation and purification. It appears that the historical origins of this discursive model of war can be traced back to the period of World War II.
In conclusion, this thesis suggests the need for the further studies of the connections between the ways identity is constructed linguistically in the narratives of foreign policy and decisions made by politicians. Another question of utmost importance is whether there is a substitution to war as a social mechanism of Russian
3

society to experience its moral appropriateness and adherence to moral standards of justice.

Introduction
Despite the fact that Russia is no longer a superpower, and doubtfully even a great power, Russian foreign policy continues to be in the center of debates in both academic and policy circles. One of central empirical puzzles about Russian foreign policy is the logic of its decision-making. Indeed, Russia has played – and continues to play – a high-profile role in most modern security crises, including North Korea’s and Iran’s nuclear programs, armed conflicts in the Southern Caucasus, and the continuing war in Ukraine which has provoked increased militarization of NATO’s eastern borders and alliance security goals in general. During the last two years, two other topics have moved into the focus of discussion: alleged Russian interference in the elections in Western countries and the role Russia plays in Syria and the Middle East in general. What is more, the role of Russia in these conflicts is usually self-contradictory, unpredicted, and antagonistic towards the main actors of international security. Consequently, it is of no surprise that understanding Russian foreign policy and its security and military policy continues to attract the attention if scholars and publicists. Consequently, the question of how particular decisions are understood in Russia are relevant from both a theoretical perspective, which is addressed in a separate chapter, but more importantly on an empirical level. One particular question which still requires conceptualization is Russian interference in the Syrian civil war in September 2015.
The Russian military operation in Syria began on September 30th, 2015 after the government of Bashar Assad had made an official request for military help. At this point, Russian involvement mostly included air raids and bombings of all anti-Assad forces including the Syrian National Coalition, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), al-Nusra Front (al-Qaeda in the Levant), and the Army of Conquest. There was limited involvement of ground troops and special operation forces. On March 14, 2016 the ""main body"" of Russian forces were officially withdrawn from the country. However, low-intensity operations and occasional air strikes continued. No substantial changes in the number of territories securely controlled by pro-government forces had been achieved. The airstrikes had become the target of criticism of the Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and Doctors Without Borders, since Russian fighters often targeted hospitals alongside military objects and caused thousands of civilian
6

causalities, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Allegedly, the Russian military used unguided bombs, cluster bombs, incendiaries similar to white phosphorus, and thermobaric weapons. According to independent estimates, the cost of damaged caused by Russian military involvement is around 38 billion rubles or $546 million.
What is more, Russian involvement in the Syrian conflict continues into the present day, being one of the riskiest factors in the current international relations agenda, since it is in Syria where there is potential for a direct military confrontation between Russian and US troops. In February 2018, there was already one such confrontation in which hundreds of Russian mercenaries have allegedly been killed – at the battle of Khasham. Moreover, it appears that either the Russian elite in fact did not care at all about the ISIS threat, or it was genuinely committed to the salvation of the Bashar -Assad regime. During the first months of operation, the Russian political leadership exhibited signs of very limited understanding of the true configuration of the fighting parties in Syria.
To understand how Russian participation in the Syrian civil war can be addressed to contribute to global peace, rather than starting World War III, it is important to address the logic behind Russia’s initial decision to interfere. Despite the fact that war has been raging for three years there remains a lack of comprehensible analysis of the Russian motivation to intervene that would explain the seemingly selfcontradictory Russian behavior.
Firstly, there is a clear gap between alleged Russian goals in Syria and the results of its actions. Initially, Vladimir Putin claimed that the main goal of Russian intervention is to fight against the Islamic State. However, it was later revealed that the absolute majority of Russian airstrikes targeted armed Syrian opposition instead of ISIS. Second, a major paradox concerning Russia’s operations in Syria is its intentions concerning possible cooperation with the Western-led anti-ISIS coalition. On the one hand, Russia wanted to befriend this coalition, while on the other hand actively opposing it.
The relevance of the question “what was the logic behind Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war” still remains urgent and, I would argue, yet unanswered. What is more, I would argue that it is impossible to answer this question following the logic of
7

utilitarianism which treats language and rhetoric exclusively as tools to achieve certain objective interests. Instead, I am going to address the problem of Russian intervention from a constructivist perspective, where the language, identity, and rhetoric are not factors of decisions made, but instead the very environment of the decision-making process. Following the general approach of post-positivism, the thesis focuses not on the material and causal explanations of a particular foreign policy phenomenon, but on the processes around how narratives of security are created (Lomagin 2007) or how identity influences the understanding of security and shapes security policies (Kassianova 2001; Hopf 2005; Williams & Neumann 2000). In the case of Russia, particular importance is attached to the narrative of ‘Great Power’ which, according to studies, simultaneously limits the range of available policies (Clunan 2009) as enables actions that would be incomprehensible for an ordinary country (Volgy et al., 2011, Ambrosio, 2005). They do not interfere with foreign policy but are foreign policy; and foreign policy, especially when full of self-contradictions, can only be understood through deep deconstruction of the narrative that reflects this policy. Thus, my research is connected with the general debate in international relations theory, the details of which I address in the theory chapter.
Aim of the research The aim of the thesis is to deconstruct the security narrative and the logic of
action behind the decision of Russian elite to intervene into the Syrian civil war. Following the post-positivist approach, the analysis of media data available will provide an insight into Russian understanding of security decision formation.
The object of the research This thesis analyses a particular phenomenon of modern Russian foreign policy
– the Russian decision to intervene into the Syrian civil war from the perspective of the security narrative which was built in Russian media to justify this decision. Apart from the security narrative, the logic of foreign policy action behind the security narrative is the focus of the study.
The period in the focus of this research is from the 30th of September 2015, with the actual beginning of Russian air forces operations in the country, and ends on March 14th, 2016 when, according to Vladimir Putin, “goals set in front of Russian Ministry of
8

Defense and Russian military are generally met.” However, since any decision is premediated, the analysis of Russian discourse begins earlier than September 2015 – in May 2015 when the pre-mediation campaign has begun.
Research Hypothesis/Argument The initial argument of this thesis is that the logic behind the Russian
intervention, as well as the security narrative of this decision, cannot be understood in a separation from the rhetorical function of war phenomenon in Russian identity. This function is centered on the idea of war as a way of “being right” and therefore “being great.”
In particular, this thesis argues that within Russian discourse, the performative element of warfare as an opportunity to present itself in a way that would reflect Russian self-image, as well as to communicate with significant partners on the international arena, has been of utmost importance to the Russian leadership.
Research methods Apart from secondary literature analysis in the theoretical chapter of the thesis,
the empirical study of media data will be conducted following the discourse analysis approach. In a separate chapter, it is explained why both the method and the data selected are relevant to answer the research question of the thesis. To understand the discourse of war in modern Russia, an analysis of a total of 36 Sunday news reports via the program Vesti Nedeli is conducted.
Limitations of the research As with any interpretivist study there is a danger that the performed analysis gap
is only a part of the complex discourse, with existing opportunities for yet deeper deconstruction. Moreover, the very theoretical background of the research avoids providing strong causal answers for the problem in question.
Structure of the paper The submitted thesis consists of the following structure. The first is this
beginning introductory chapter and outline. The second chapter provides a theoretical overview of the foundation of the proposed thesis: the role of narratives and language in security policy formation. Additionally, the second chapter explains the methodology of
9

the research, relevance of selected data, as well as justification for why it is representation of the worldview behind Russian foreign policy. The third chapter is the actual discourse analysis of the selected data with no interpretations to this data given. The objective of the paper is to discern the structural elements of the Russian narrative as it was constructed. In the fourth and final chapter, the revealed narratives are analyzed against the background of other actions made by the Russian government and contextualized in the view of existing theories. In the conclusion, the argument developed in this introduction is further developed and potential practical implementations of the research are presented.

Synopsis Having identified the aim, relevance, object of the research, hypothesis, and
methodology, this thesis will proceed according to the structure described above: from theoretical debate to the empirical analysis of media data.
During the literature review, theoretical justification for the approach used in the research will be given. In the following two chapters, empirical analysis of selected data will be conducted and then contextualized against the background of other approaches to examine the logics behind Russian foreign policy actions.
This thesis explores the complex relationship between the rhetorical function of war in the Russian political imaginary and the Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war. Then concluding with a summary of the findings and the practical importance of the thesis. Lists of references and media data used are provided at the end of the research.

Chapter I. Theory and Method
Theoretical approach of the research
In order to answer the research question of the thesis, the approach of social constructivism has been chosen. Its adherents put particular emphasis on the role of identities: “at the center of political activity is the construction of a link between policy and identity that makes the two appear consistent with each other” (Hansen, 2006, p.28). In the framework of this thesis, there is little space to for an in-depth look at the details of all aspects of the existing debate between the proponents of the different logics of social action. Instead, the research is focused on the one particular element of social action: the role language, identity, and discourse play in the international relations from the perspective of foreign policy shaping.
However, before moving any further with the thesis it is important to answer, as the researcher, if all the discourse and narratives spread by Russian officials and media will be treated the same way – exclusively as a set of rhetorical actions, or if it will assume that, apart from being a part of propaganda projects, these statements reflect deep normative and strategic beliefs of the Russian elite about Russia and its role in international relations. There is no right or wrong answer to this question, however, though there are strong reasons to deny the Russian statements any real meaning. After all, modern Russia is a trend-setter in terms of post-truth politics, including media and war.
Here it is important to point out that focus on language does not necessarily imply the choice of social constructivism as the theoretical foundation of the research. For example, one way of looking into the problem of the discourse and language’s function in international relations is an instrumentalist perspective which, more or less, fits into the logic of consequentialism’s approach. This tradition is represented in particular by the school of “rhetorical action,” for which discourse and values is an intervening variable in an actor’s behavior. It can be used to empower an otherwise weak side or to limit the range of possible politics. A good example of rhetorical power that can be found in the mechanisms of the security community is the expansion of the
12

EU in 2004, as it is presented in Schimmelfenning’s piece “The Community trap: Liberal norms, Rhetorical Action” (Schimmelfenning, 2001). In his interpretation, those Eastern European countries that became EU members in 2004 managed to successfully exercise a “rhetorical action” strategy – the strategic use of a norms-based argument by weakly socialized actors in a community whose constitutive values and norms they share.
Here the research highlights that, on a theoretical level, studies of the school of “rhetorical action” are conducted in the same utilitarian tradition as those of the realist school. In other words, they treat identity politics, discourse, rhetoric, and norms as tools through which weak or strong political actors can achieve a pragmatic goal. Thus, we are dealing with essentially the same ontology as in political realism when symbolic politics have no value on their own and with the actors being completely free to refer to them, depending on political interests. This approach has certain merits as it allows one to look beyond mere language games, if one assumes that the real matter of international politics is exclusively one of power and force with everything else being only a recourse for power maximization.
In contrast to rhetorical action, social constructivism offers an epistemological approach for the analysis of foreign policy, being focused not on the event itself but on the interpretations of said event. For example, while investigating the meaning of 9/11 for American security policies, Krebs and Lobasz argue that: “We proceed rather from the presumption that September 11, like all political events, did not speak for itself. It required interpretation, and it did not have to lead to a War on Terror … how it was publicly represented and by whom, how, and whether those representations were contested … The world we lived in after September 11 was by no means inevitable, and alternative worlds could have emerged … while the attacks were very real, the insecurity they generated was necessarily a cultural production” (Lobasz&Krebs, 2007, p. 413). Consequently, instead of power, ideas, or interests, in the center of Krebs and Lobasz’ analysis lies language itself. This approach is more structured in the later book of Krebs – “Narrating foreign policy.” He argues that the largest questions of national security require leaders to engage public audiences and thus to legitimate, or provide public justification for, the policies they prefer. Moreover, not all possible policies can be legitimated in the public sphere, with conceivable but non-legitimate policies being
13

impossible to pursue. As a result, much of national security politics is centered on the competition over the meaning of events. Once such a competition is temporally resolved, a dominant narrative emerges which shapes the national security policies that states pursue (Krebs, 2015, pp.2-3).
It is interesting that Krebs’s approach often pays respect to the utilitarian usage of strategic narratives or what can be called a rhetorical action. However, for this approach language also appears to have more value on its own. In particular, the nonutilitarian role of narratives is important for Krebs when a new situation emerges – something previously unimaginable and inconceivable, for which no rules exist. In his other piece “Twisting Tongues and Twisting Arms: The Power of Political Rhetoric,” Krebs, in co-authorship with Patrick Jackson, defines his approach to foreign policy as coercive constructivism, arguing that: “the social identity has an effect on social and political outcomes, regardless of whether or not the actor internalizes the components constituting this identity” (Jackson, Krebs, 2007, p.57). This coercive constructivism placed the importance of language games beyond utilitarian rhetorical action as “elites, even brilliant and authoritative orators, do not stand outside or transcend social structures that they then manipulate at will” (Krebs, 2015, p.4). Moreover, “it is through narrative that human beings order disordered experience and impart meaning to themselves and their world. Insofar as any grand strategy rests on a coherent portrait of the global environment, it rests on narrative” (Krebs, 2015, p.2).
The coercive constructivist approach assumes that the analysis of the claims Russian foreign policy makes is important no matter if the country is capable of supporting them. From this perspective, claims help discern the strategic narrative that the country’s foreign policy decision makers believe in since, “alleged facts acquire meaning only when people weave them into coherent stories” (Krebs, 2015, p. 4). Consequently, the stories told by the Russian elite reflect the world as it is seen by Russian foreign policy. However, “the existence of a public sphere ensures that actors have to regularly and routinely explain and justify their behavior” (Risse, 2000, p. 21), and there is no conditional link between justification and truth. In other words, if one wants to see inside Russian foreign policy, then one has to look into it from within; giving Russian messages the benefit of a doubt in a way that, no matter how Russian military, diplomatic, and economic capabilities are developed, the language used by the
14

Russian mainstream reflects the world as seen by the Russian decision-makers. Consequently, it is possible to assume that the foreign policy decisions made by the country during recent years are the result of the way the Russian elite sees itself and the country.
In the submitted thesis the approach of social constructivism is applied and, despite its limitations, addresses the same challenges and problems that make the claims of the “rhetorical action” model so appealing. First, however, it is necessary to explain what the key elements of this approach are and how, hypothetically, they can be applied to study the problem of the logic behind Russian foreign policy in general, and the decision to intervene in Syria in particular.
To begin with, instead of power or interests, social constructivism views language as the essence of politics. This ontological claim reflects the choice any researcher has to make while discussing either domestic or international politics. There are several arguments that strengthen such a huge role attached to language. Indeed, “only humans give voice to the moral sense; only they articulate, reason about and debate good and evil, noble and ignoble, beneficial and harmful” (Krebs, 2015, p.8). Without such articulations no interests can be recognized and no power plays can be performed. Moreover, human actions, including political aims, are inherently limited by what one perceives as undoubtedly true, right, and just. Additionally, these perceptions are not random but structured in discourses and narratives. Discourse, as Michel Foucault famously argues, “is the thing for which and by which there is struggle, discourse is the power to be seized’ (Foucault, 1981, p. 52-53). While scholars of rational choice would argue that, “states have little choice but to adapt themselves to the dictates of an unforgiving international system, that narratives are the product of events whose meaning is clear to all, or that a narrative’s dominance simply reflects the interests of powerful groups and leaders” (Krebs, 2015, p.2), social constructivists will look into how narratives and discourses exist and evolve through revealing their assumptions, contradictions, and metaphors (Steele 2010; Jarvis and Holland, 2014). What is more, under the social constructivist approach the processes through which one can analyze these deep-rooted beliefs are inherently public and linguistic, and that is why the analysis of public communication including media is relevant.
15

Russian security policy is not an exception from a social constructivist analysis. There are two main arguments to why it is fruitful for this thesis. Firstly, the paper will defend the idea that security policy, as well as national interest, depends on political purpose (Clunan, 2009, p. 31). Though, as a social constructivist would argue, the political can be understood only through linguistic means within a particular narrative that gives sense to these means. It also makes sense to follow Threvor Thrall’s argument, according to which a researcher should be less skeptical of the idea of “identity-based politics” in comparison with instrumentalism. In particular, Thrall argues that “threat framing provides a more useful explanatory tool than elite manipulation of information in understanding threat perceptions” (Thrall, 2007, p.484).
Secondly, social constructivism addresses the problem of looking into Russian logic from the perspective of this logic and not from an outsider’s assumptions of it. Indeed, no matter how Russian discourse is seen from the outside, it still reflects assumptions, contradictions, and metaphors regarding how Russian decision makers think about foreign policy. And since this discourse is important for those who set up the agenda for Russian foreign policy, it is also important for those who study it. In fact, narrative is not necessarily underpinned by the utilitarian interests of political actors, but rather by the intrinsic value of the established frames that enable the non-contradictory worldview. After all, as Krebs and Jackson argue, “arguments can prove powerful only when the commonplaces on which they draw are already present in the rhetorical field” (Jakson&Krebs, 2007, p.46). Politicians are rarely completely free or instrumental while creating security narratives or making sense out of a new security event. Neither can they be purely utilitarian. They have to follow and modify frames that were already present in the public discourse, with the public being influenced by rhetoric created decades prior to the matter in question.
As an interim conclusion, it is possible to argue that identity and symbolic power influence the development of security-related decisions. All schools of international relations agree with this statement one way or another. The main debate is whether such an effect is a result of utilitarian calculations. or whether identity and beliefs affect foreign policy on a deeper level by pre-mediating the security-related decisions through maintaining the worldview decision-makers consider worth defending or promoting. Ultimately, an answer to this question is the choice of a researcher.
16

In this thesis, I agree with those scholars who look into the questions of identity and rhetoric in a less instrumental way. Instead, one can view language games and security frames as phenomena that form the preferences of an actor before the need to act has even emerge. It appears that, prior to making a security decision, one must determine “who am I” and “how does the world look?” This is precisely the moment when identity and values become extremely important since they essentially provide the ability to act to make any decision in principle. Following this approach, while conducting a security analysis, the scholar himself must deliberate what the worldview of an actor was, in what frames was it described, how these frames have emerged etc. Moreover, it would be necessary to lower skepticism and any initial inclination to treat rhetoric as a manipulative tool, and to treat it as indication of certain beliefs or outcome of historical practices instead. This is especially difficult after 2014, in the so-called post-truth epoch when the borderline between trolling, fake, and genuine belief became nearly unintelligible. Although, for those who are interested in identity, values, language, and narratives in their relations to security subjects, it appears that there is no better choice.

Methodology of the research
Qualitative discourse analysis is the foundational methodology of this research. Discourse analysis assumes that ""...political thought and behaviour... cannot be understood without references to the distinctive vocabularies used by agents in given context... "" (Richter, 1995, 124). In other words, the primary analysis of this method is that the way people communicate is the key to understand the decisions they make. Generally speaking, discourse can be understood in two ways. It can be seen as the coherent whole of certain rules that operate on a macro level and structure the way people think. Consequently, there can be several discursive fields that deal with different problems. The second understanding is narrower – discourse is meant to be a coherent set of statements. At the same time, as it was mentioned in the previous chapter, in the framework of this research discourse is understood, not as aspects of language, but as a system of meanings assigned to objects through linguistic means. This system reflects shared beliefs and common values (Fisher, Gottweis, 2012). Within this system, multiple narratives can exist, with narrative being conceptualized as structures linking the various elements of the discourse into a coherent, portrayable, and communicable form.
Since the character of the data which is used for this research is both visual and textual, instead of computational discourse analysis such as spatial models (Medzihorsky, Popovich, Jenne, 2017), the approach chosen in this thesis is manual deconstruction of the text with particular importance being attached to unclear references and indirect notions that the discourse is often constructed of. The goal is not to calculate Russian foreign policy utility functions but instead to figure out what worldview it operates in, and whether this worldview is understood as a hegemonic or dominant narrative. A hegemonic narrative is not a new idea for international relations theory. As Stuart Hall points out, hegemonic projects aspire to the remaking of common sense (Hall, Du Gay, 1996). Moreover, security can also be understood in this framework: “a dominant narrative of national security is a realized hegemonic project. It is a social fact, not an object of active political challenge. During such routine times, there is political contest, sometimes even intense, but it is usually takes place within the terms of the dominant narrative” (Krebs, 2015, 5). For this research, the narrative of
18

Russian foreign policy is understood as a hegemonic narrative in which importance goes beyond rhetoric, being the means of structuring the social order.
Justification of the type of data selection
To answer the research question, apart from the official statements of the Russian officials, the main data type consists of weekly 1-hour long Sunday news programs from the most popular Russian TV show “Vesti Nedeli.” There are several reasons why pro-governmental Sunday news reports provide this research with representative material on Russian elite’s understanding of foreign policy.
To begin with, the unique character of Russian pro-governmental media allows consideration of them as the voice of power that represents its worldview. The Russian government also has an absolute control over federal television which remains very influential in today’s Russia. The majority of the Russian population still treat federal TV news broadcasts to be the primary source of information. As polls conducted in December 2015 indicate (Levada–Tsentr, 2015): only 21% of Russian citizens acquire its information about the world from the Internet, only 13% from social networks, and 85% from TV. Moreover, around two-thirds of the population have no access to a source of information that is independent from the government (Levada–Tsentr, 2015). Maria Lipman (2009) describes the situation in Russian federal television as ‘national channels are mostly aimed at those Russians who constitute the reliable electoral base of Putin’s regime: the more provincial, the elderly, the less educated’.
Vladimir Putin managed to create a complex system of control over media both traditional and digital (Belin, 2002, 21). In other words, “the Russian media ecology today is characterized by an abundance of information, but also by a set of mechanisms which limit the accessibility of that information. In these circumstances, the Russian elite – as with Putin, above – is able to use the saturation of media as a means to obfuscate the extent to which it has realigned the media ecology to its own ends” (Hoskings, Shchelin, 2018). On praxis, it means that the modern Russian authoritarian government has, to a certain extent, limitless opportunities to frame media coverage of an any event, compared to authorities in a democracy. In particular, Russian mainstream media does not face elasticity constraints explored by (Baum&Groeling, 2010) who
19

argue: “Early in a conflict, elites, especially the president, have an informational advantage that renders public perceptions of ‘reality’ very elastic. As events unfold and as the public gathers more information, this elasticity recedes, allowing alternative frames to challenge the administration’s preferred frame” (Baum & Groeling, 2010, 443).
In contrast to democratic regimes, the Russian media is an example of an “arrested one.” From a media studies perspective, this means the following: the 2000s were a time of optimism and belief in the possibilities of new media to not only combat the production of fakes, but also overcome the problem of agenda-setting and gatekeeping by large national news organizations. It appeared that modern technologies had opened a window of opportunities for journalists to provide their viewers with dozens of competing narratives in a digitized environment. These opportunities included, for instance, networked communication (Barzilai-Nahon, 2008), citizen journalism (Allan & Thorsen, 2009) and citizen witnessing (Allan, 2013). In the world of transparent media, fake production should have become impossible. However, in the 2010s, old concerns about the role of mass media in conflict depiction returned. According to the framework designed by Andrew Hoskings & Ben O'Loughlin (Hoskings, O'Loughlin 2015), war and media relations have entered the third phase— “the arrested warfare.” This phase has brought the return of questions that were considered to have been settled during the previous years.
The process of adaptation of news institutions and governmental organizations has taken place. The very multitude of information available has paved the way towards a principle change in the nature of media production. There is no problem for a viewer to get information; on the contrary, one is overloaded with hundreds of thousands of facts including thousands of fakes. As a result, the goal of modern media has shifted from information production to information verification. Rather than collecting information, which can be exercised by networks of independent bloggers and journalists, mainstream media enjoys the power of agenda setting. Dominant media possesses a kind of authority to produce a particular report or image making it “fair” and recognizable for the massive audience. Against the background of millions of information pieces, “any content that is acclaimed as alternative, oppositional, or
20

outside only acquires significant value when acknowledged and remediated by the mainstream” (Hoskings, O'Loughlin , 2015, 1323).
All the descriptions of the character of the Russian media environment is necessary to indicate the often-undervalued element of Russian propaganda. Having no uncontrolled competitors for the hegemonic narrative in media, the authority can afford to ignore the contestation element of any news message. As the result, the Russian government enjoys a unique kind of recourse – the power to create a TV reality, which will dominate the popular discourse. What is more, this kind of reality does not have to comply with actual events in the country or around the globe. In other words, because domestic media ecology is so comfortable for the Russian elite, it can be used as the means of retranslating foreign policy principles and worldviews to fit their beliefs. Counter-intuitively, precisely because mainstream media is not independent in Russia and has no agency of its own, as well as having its audience consist of a population who takes its messages at face value, pro-governmental media discourse can be treated as the reflection of the deep-rooted beliefs and principles of Russian foreign-policy decisionmakers.
At the same time, there is a lack of studies that genuinely attempt to deconstruct the message of Russian pro-governmental media. Most are focused on treating media exclusively as an instrument of state policy (Pomerantsev and Weiss, 2014; Van Herpen 2016) based on the frameworks of ""agenda setting"" (McCombs and Shaw, 1972) and ""gatekeeping"" (White, 1997). For this research, such an approach of the data treatment is too narrow. Instead, this thesis applies an alternative to the instrumental approach that treats media as the “spaces of appearances” (Silverstone, 2007; Arendt, 1998), places where political practices are played out (Livingstone, 2009). From this standpoint Russian pro-governmental media can be treated as a reliable source of data on Russian foreign policy hegemonic discourse, and that can provide an insight into the logic behind Russian foreign policy formation processes.
Data Timeline Justification
The main body of data consists of every, roughly 1-hour long, “Vesti Nedeli” issued from May 2015 to March 2016 – the period from the beginning of the
21

legitimation campaign for the intervention in Syria in Russian media until the first official “withdrawal” of Russian troops from Syria. This timeline is established empirically. Using the media analytic platform of Medialogia (http://www.mlg.ru/), it became possible to collect the data on the intensity of the presence of certain themes on Russian federal TV channels, including the war in Syria. The Medialogia database is usually used by PR-specialists and, unfortunately, does not provide free access to its files for the average user. However, upon my request, I was provided with short-term access (3 days) to the database and managed to collect all necessary data, which can be presented in raw format upon request. The results of the data collection are presented in Table 1 and indicate that, in as early as the first month, one can observe the trend of the increased presence of the “Syria” problem in the media— precisely in May 2015. Following this timeline, the research performs qualitative discourse analysis of all Sunday news programmes of Vesti Nedeli with Dmitrii Kiseleov. Fortunately, all data on this news program is available online on the official you-tube channel of Vesti media: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMLaYWKvM0Q&list=PL6MnxjOjSRsRzsISAl U-JcbTi7_a5wB_v). In total 36 news programs were analyzed.
In sum, the proposed methodology is adequate for the research question of the paper. The thesis has a reliable data source, with the data itself being representative of the problem analyzed. The selected research method allows the deconstruction of the existing hegemonic narrative and addresses the implicit problem of the logic of foreign policy actions hidden behind the words of Russian propaganda makers. In the following chapter of the thesis, the findings of this qualitative analysis – the detailed deconstruction of the legitimation of the Russian intervention into the Syrian civil war as it can be seen in Russian mainstream media – are presented.
22

Chapter II. Russian Narrative of its intervention in Syrian civil war
To begin the analysis of Russian military operations one has to start with the analysis of the exact goals and tasks set by the Russian military leadership in front of the Russian troops and its allies. It is not an easy assignment as, even during the first period of intervention, official goals have been changed several times. Initially Vladimir Putin claimed that the main goal of Russian intervention is to fight against the Islamic State. What is more, officially the upper house of the Russian Parliament issued a mandate to Putin on September 30th to provide “exclusively air support for Syrian government forces in their operation against ISIS.” During his speech at the UN headquarters on the second day of the Russian intervention (September 28, 2015) Putin argued for the creation of an international coalition of ""all forces that resist the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations."" Two weeks later, the fight against ISIS suddenly turned into the stabilization of the legitimate regime of Bashar Assad.
In February 2016, Sergey Lavrov returned to the counter-terrorism narrative as justification of Russian air strikes: ""Russian airstrikes won't be terminated until we actually annihilate terrorist organizations: ISIL, Jabhat an-Nusra and the like. I see no reasons to terminate these strikes."" This, among other goals, claimed to be the rationale behind Russian intervention as mentioned by the Russian commander-in-chief: ""to clear Syria from the terrorist fighters and protect Russia from possible terrorist attacks"" and ""stabilising the legitimate power in Syria and creating the conditions for political compromise"" (Levada, 2015).
As the result, the narrative of Russian intervention into the Syrian civil war has never been exactly structured within the statements of Russian officials. In contrast, from the very beginning the intervention consisted of multiple ideas, which were complexly intertwined during TV shows. Consequently, to investigate the narrative of
23

the Russian intervention from the Russian perspective, one has to deconstruct it first to its elements and then reveal how they were connected.
Therefore, the structure of this part of the thesis is as follows. The first chapter is mostly descriptive and divided into three parts: Part One will present what can be called the “rationalist narrative” of intervention; Part Two will reveal the “ethical narrative,” and Part Three will be concerning the “diplomatic narrative” of the conflict. In the second chapter the collected data and revealed narratives will be analyzed in the context of existing literature on Russian identity and its connection with foreign policy.
24

Part I. “Rationalist narratives”
1.1 “Preventive measures”
The intervention in Syria has been justified in the Russian state narrative in multiple ways. This thesis begins with an analysis of the narrative that can be considered the “most official,” since it was used by the Russian president during the first days of intervention. In particular, the purpose of Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war has been proclaimed necessary to protect Russia against the terrorist threat of ISIS. To be more precise, Russian media claimed that, “should the government of Bashar Assad fall, terrorists will get resources to move toward our borders: in Central Asia, the Caucasus and Russia. Therefore, it is better to stop the barbarians there” (VN, 27/09/2015, 3:39)1. However, in contrast to other narratives, the idea of “preventive measures” serves as a background for more important Russian propaganda theses. There are several reasons to claim this.
To begin with, the first references to this narrative appear not long before the intervention began – on September the 13th, when the show runner announced that the direct threat for Damascus posed during the offense of terrorist forces creates a new challenge to Russia (VN, 13/09/2015, 8:51).
Secondly the “preventive measures” narrative has been highlighted only during four issues of the TV program: on September 20th “barbaric Caliphate is crawling towards Russia” (VN, 20/09/2015, 16:29), on September 27th and repeated October 4th “active defense against closing enemy” (VN, 4/10/2015, 3:23), later on December 27th “we must not let the hordes of terrorists from there come to us” (VN, 27/12/2015, 6:57), and finally referring to it on the 20th of March 2016 “had we not interfered the barbarians would have already been here” (VN, 20/03/2015, 3:39). In contrast to the screen time devoted to the promotion and discussion of other elements of war in Syria, the idea of “preventive measures” was referred to only during the launch of the

operation in its first “completion” and before the New Year when the general narrative of Russian intervention in Syria was re-affirmed.
In sum, a detailed analysis of the TV news report puts “preventive measures” justification of the intervention in a delicate position. On the one hand it is an integral part of the general narrative of the Russian operation in Syria. It marks its beginning and its end. On the other hand its importance in contrast to other narratives is relatively small, as if the Russian media itself does not fully believe in the potential of this idea to justify the operation in the eyes of the domestic audience.
1.2 “Military exercise”
The second rationalist narrative of the intervention in Syria is the demonstration of Russian military might and military exercise of Russian pilots in a real war environment. For example, on October the 11th, Russian television has been praising “first combat experience of the newest Russian ballistic missile” (VN, 10/10/2015, 5:28). Moreover, for the following ten minutes, Dmitrii Kisiliov had been comparing the Russian missile “Kalibr” to the American “Tomahawk.” Later the narrative of “military might demonstration” was repeated on December 27th.
A key difference in this narrative is that it has never been announced, but rather presented in a purely visual way for direct TV-reports from the battlegrounds. In fact, often the “Syria-part” of Sunday news broadcasts had been constructed from two parts – which in this thesis I define as “preaching” and “war porn.” “Preaching” involves the show-runner explaining the logic, goal, and meaning of the event to the audience. Whereas “war porn” intends to entertain the viewers using computer-game type videos. The former is essentially textual, and it is the “preaching” which will be the focus of the analysis of this thesis. The latter is mostly visual. This thesis won’t analyze this element of Russian media coverage of the Syrian civil war in detail however, it is important to point out that 5-10 minutes of TV reports from Syrian battlefronts have become essential parts of all Sunday news reports from the begging of the time intervention to the end of the period of observation. This also explains why preference during the military operation was given towards air strikes of different kinds (the newest Su-34
26

strike fighters, KA-52 attacks helicopters, Buk-M2 missile systems) – they look attractive in federal television reports and helped build an image of power.
What is more, the results of air strikes can be interpreted rather freely in media. In particular, during the first two months of Russian intervention (October –November), Russian military officials reported thousands of destroyed objects of ISIS infrastructure including dozens of headquarters. From a media perspective such a claim does not require validation – it is enough to show images and videos of landing planes and explosions on the ground. Based on these reports already in October, Russians were informed by the federal TV that decisive victory in Syria had already been achieved.
Pragmatic narrative summary Despite being repeated in times of critical junctures, pragmatic justifications for Russian intervention in Syria seem to be the least important for the Russian narrative of intervention into the Syrian civil war. It appears that the discussed arguments of the prevention of the terrorist threat to Russia and the “military exercise” idea are used in order to avoid the need to define the exact goal of Russian intervention. Consequently, since the pragmatic narrative is so non-central, other justifications for intervention must be analyzed. In particular those that are connected with the problem of the Russian self and Russian understanding of what enemy threatens this self. In the following part, the thesis discusses “ethical” and “moral” segments of the general narrative of the war in Syria that were present on Russian television during the period of observation.
27

Part II. Ethical narratives. Though it has never been part of the narrative as announced by top Russian
officials of the intervention into the Syrian civil war, ethical considerations have proven to be the central part of the war narrative on Russian television. What is more, in contrast to rationalist elements of the war narrative, “ethical discourse” is constantly reaffirmed and follows the structure proposed by Ernesto Laclau (Laclau, 2014) and Shantal Mouffe (Mouffe, 2000), who developed the concept of the “constitutive other.” This 'other' creates meaningful context for the nation self’s development which, in its turn, is possible only through such an interaction with other members of international society. In the context of war it also means that, before a nation resorts to violence in order to protect certain values or defend certain interests, it has to build an image of what these interests are. And such an understanding emerges only as a result of interaction with others or reflections on the previous experiences of such an interaction.
Consequently, in the following parts of the chapter, the thesis will discuss ethical oppositions proposed by the Russian media and what they can mean as a representation of the Russian-self in the context of the war in Syria.
2.1 “Evil against good” or “Those who cause destruction” and “Those who protect and restore”
From the very beginning of its coverage of potential Russian intervention into Syria, the Russian media has been promoting the story according to which the fight in Syria is nothing less than a clash between good and evil.
The first and most obvious evil is ISIS. ISIS is always presented in Russian media as a violent force which seeks to destroy civilization itself: “they perform the unthinkable: kill innocent children for not fasting” (VN, 28/06/2015, 1:09:22). “In Summer 2015, barbarians of the psedo-islamic Caliphate have been spreading across Syria and Iraq, they slaughtered Christians, slaughtered army officers, sunk cages full of people, destroyed the monuments of cultural heritage” (VN, 21/02/2016, 3:02). Moreover, religious motives are directly integrated into the narrative on several occasions, for example: “they [ISIS] seek to kill all Christians” (VN, 27/09/2015, 1:28:10). Therefore, the “barbaric Caliphate is the challenge for Russia and the world”
28

(VN, 27/12/2015, 4:31). Consequently, Russian actions in Syria are nothing less than a “fight to save people’s lives, to save the future of civilization” (VN, 06/12/2015, 6:59), the “fight of good against evil in Syria … good prevails” (VN, 13/03/2016, 0:47). Thus, the first layer of the ethical dimension of Russian actions in Syria is a global fight between forces of order and forces of chaos. And this fight, according to the Russian president, is “just and right” (VN, 20/03/2016, 19.04) with Vladimir Putin acting in Syria “with the generosity of a Russian and efficiency of a German” (VN, 01/11/2015, 20:32).
It is important to note that nothing is said about the political or economic motives of either side of the conflict. Instead, the Russian media presents the picture of an apocalyptic struggle in which Russia fights on the side of the “good guys.” What is more, this narrative of fighting on the side of justice is constantly reaffirmed during the whole period of observation. It appears that moral elements in Russian logic behind the decision to intervene into the Syrian civil war are far more important to Russian media than any utilitarian motive; and the result of Russian actions in Syria as it was summarized in March 2016 is that they “stopped a global, terrifying evil” (VN, 13/03/2016, 19:28).
However, ISIS is not the only destructive force the Russian narrative was focused on. If anything, ISIS is only at the forefront of a bigger fight between the forces that promote the destruction of state institutions and Russia who keeps peace and balance. Behind the self-evident evil of ISIS there is a hidden puppet master – the USA, in particular, and the West in general.
The first reference to the USA in the context of a global fight between good and evil can be found in a broadcast from June 28, 2015. While discussing the consequences of terrorist attacks in Tunisia, the Russian media claimed the United States was responsible for the chaos ruining the region: “The Arab spring, orchestrated by the USA without any feeling of responsibility, has destroyed the traditional way of life in the region and moved millions of people out of balance” (VN, 28/06/2015, 16:45). Consequently, according to the same report, ISIS “has been brought up by the USA … after they destroyed the state in Iraq” (VN, 28/06/2015, 1:07:41, 1:07:50), with the USA losing control over it (VN, 28/06/2015, 17:50) and “ISIS has been created by the USA to fight against Assad in Syria” (VN, 12/07/2015, 1:36:55).
29

In contrast to the “rationalist” narrative, references to the narrative of “destructive force” have been repeated one way or another during the period of observation: “Damascus has been fighting against terrorists supported by the might of the USA and the West” (VN, 13/09/2015, 11:04), “In Syria the USA has been fighting on the same side with the terrorist Caliphate and trying to destroy Syria” (VN, 20/09/2015, 10:19), “due to the US interventions, state institutions and way of life has been destroyed globally … instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, the USA brought violence, poverty and social catastrophe” (VN, 4/10/2015, 28:00), “the USA interfered [in countries] – left chaos behind them – left – who should clean it?” (VN, 4/10/2015, 34:48), “the USA acts with no sense of responsibility destroying countries” (VN, 13/12/2015, 13:16) etc.
Following the logic of linguistic opposition, Russian actions and motivation has been described using the following metaphor of restoration and peace: “Russia will keep supporting the government of Bashar Assad as the healthy force in its fight against terrorism” (VN, 13/09/2015, 09:59); “Russia saves Obama from the consequences of the failure of his policy in Syria” (VV, 27/09/2015, 14:19); “[The Russian goal is] to strengthen governmental institutions wherever they survived” (VV, 4/10/2015, 32:24); “Russia protects its allies” (VN, 11/10/2015, 11:11); “The Russian goal is to support the legitimate government” (VN, 18/10/2015, 12:28); and “Putin is an obstacle for those who want to destroy countries” (VN, 31/01/2015, 14:55).
Anti-Americanism has long been the cornerstone of Russian foreign policy discourse. What is important for further analysis is the fact that the USA is not criticized through interests-based arguments, but as ethically flawed. This pattern is developed even stronger in the next opposition that seems to be central for Russian propaganda: “truth” against “fakes”
2.2 “Honesty and Truth” against “Lies and Fakes” As the thesis discussed previously, Russian actions in Syria have been presented
as the fight between good and evil. However, the civil war in Syria was not just between the government of Bashar Assad and ISIS. By the moment of Russian intervention, the US-led coalition had been performing air strikes against ISIS for 5 months. What is more, since ISIS and the USA were nothing else but different sides of evil, the Russian
30

narrative had to provide its audience with an explanation of why one evil force is fighting against the other. In the following part, this thesis discusses another central opposition in the Syrian civil war discourse on Russian television, which seems to provide an answer to this paradox – “truth against lies”.
Adjectives used most frequently on Russian television, while talking about Russian actions in Syria and events surrounding them, are “honest” and “real” – “Russia is ready to participate in a real anti-terrorist coalition with an honest purpose and real coordination of the actions of all healthy forces involved” (VN, 13/09/2015, 10:10), “Russia is open to ally with all powers who honestly fight against terrorism” (VN, 11/10/2015, 30:21), “we must honestly unite our efforts, we must honestly stop tearing the planet apart” (VN, 24/01/2016, 4:02), “Russia has no hidden intentions, it is honest” (VN, 14/02/2016, 15:51), “due to powerful and honest airstrikes terrorists are retreating” (VN, 21/02/2016, 5:30), “truly grateful Syrians who kept telling me: ‘Russians are honest’” (VN, 13/03/2016, 0:47).
Accordingly, while discussing the character of two anti-terrorist coalitions, the Russian narrative usually followed the binary opposition “real” and “fake.” Discounting, in fact, the sincerity of the international fight against ISIS which had begun before the decision of the Russian government to intervene in the Syrian civil war was announced. Already as of the 28th of June, the following narrative had been presented to the Russian audience: “Americans and the West, following them, claim to fight against terrorist Caliphate and it appears they bomb someone, somewhere. In reality though ISIS is now acting not as a terrorist group but as a state, with its own foreign trade … selling it to buyers in the West” (VN, 28/06/2018, 1:10:43).
During the first months of Russian intervention, nearly every Sunday news report from Syria reaffirmed this idea: “Americans and their fake ATC dare to blame Assad for hypocrisy” (VN, 20/09/2015, 12:53), “there are two coalitions – fake one, that allowed terrorist to advance and effective one, led by Putin, whether Americans like its action or not” (VN, 27/09/2015, 4:15), “the USA failed to achieve any visible results, may be because they bomb wrong side, in a wrong place and time?” (VN, 27/09/2015, 33:55), “if the coalition really wants to fight against ISIS?” (VN, 11/10/15, 31:15), “The American goal is to get rid of Assad, ours is to get rid of
31

terrorists” (VN, 25/10/2015, 39:56), and “nobody wanted to fight with terrorists for real” (VN, 21/02/2016, 3:56).
It is clear that for the Russian narrative, the issue of “truth” against “lie” is one at the very heart. It appears that, for the Russian leadership, it was important to present Russia not just as another force or great power projecting its interests but as a party to a conflict which acts based on a higher moral standard than its rivals. The following chapter of the thesis will discuss the potential logic behind such a particular way to treat the conflict. However, before this, one has to uncover other elements of the Russian narrative
2.3 “Those who can” and “Those who can not” Another opposition between the Russian self and the ‘other’ is connect with the
“truth against lie” problem but differs in its conclusions. As it was discussed before in the Russian frame, key attention has been attached to the problem of the difference between Russian and Western actions against ISIS. The first half of the Russian argument presumes that Western coalition simply only pretends to fight ISIS, however its second half implies that the West is also incapable of completing the mission to defeat terrorists and therefore it needs the help of Russia.
In particular, this discourse can be observed in the statements such as: “there are no efficient actions against ISIS yet” (VN, 13/09/15, 10:20), the “fate of both Russia and Europe depends on Russian actions in Syria” (VN, 13/09/15, 25:31), “Europe can not see the true picture in Syria” (VN, 20/09/15, 10:19), “Europe is standing in front of the problem it cannot solve” (VN, 4/10/2015, 3:23), “for the 4th time in its history Russia saves Europe” (VN, 4/10/2015, 31:08), “the USA fails to do the job [winning against ISIS]” (VN, 4/10/2015, 33:55) etc. Or, as was stated by the Russian president, ""it is with the participation of the Russian military men that the Syrian Army and the patriotic forces of Syria managed to cardinally stem the tide in the fight against international terrorism and gain momentum in all directions"" (Izvestia, 2016).
Connected with this part of the narrative is the depiction of the migration crisis in Europe. Though this depiction is subject for separate research, there are several points to be made concerning the image of Europe as an actor, incapable of dealing with its problems. First, reports regarding the migration crisis are usually followed, or
32

preceded, by reports from Syria and were often as long. For example, on the 20th of September, a week before Russian intervention began, a report about the refugee threat was 20 minutes long – only 4 minutes longer than a report about Syria. Secondly, migrants are always presented as forces of chaos, destruction and panic. Thirdly, within the Russian narrative this chaos is exclusively the result of US activity in the Middle East: “Refugees flee to Europe not from Assad but from terrorists who are encouraged by the USA to fights against the legitimate government in Damascus” (VN, 13/09/2015, 13:04) “Obama pushes the lines of refugees towards Europe” (VN, 13/09/2015, 13:40).
In contrast to the “truth-fake” opposition, the idea of an incompetent West is different from the perspective of potential actions morally available to Russia. First and foremost, it has allowed Russia to make room for dialog and cooperation with the West within its discourse. Being completely out of the question before the intervention has launched this call for unity with the West has become integral part of the Russian narrative after the operation has been launched. How this idea has become integrated in the discussed oppositions is the subject of the next part of the chapter.
Ethical narratives summary After the reconstruction of the ethical elements in the Russian narrative of its intervention in the Syrian civil war, a general image of the Russian self can be created. This thesis summarizes it in the following way: “we are those who can prevail over evil because we are honest and just and therefore good”. In contrast to pragmatic narratives, this image of self has been present during the entire period of observation and could be considered a central pillar of the Russian intervention narrative as a whole. Therefore, the operation in Syria from the perspective of the Russian narrative is clearly not about pragmatism, but rather an area where the Russian self can present itself to the world. However, as in any system of discourse, it is not enough to determine what is “self” and who is the significant ‘other,’ especially when the ‘other’ is not homogeneous. It is equally important how communication between the two is possible. Consequently, the next question for analysis is how the Russian “self” is connected with the international environment and what it wants from its partners within the Russian narrative.
33

Part III. “Diplomatic narrative”
The Russian intervention in Syria has happened not in vacuum, but in an international context. As it was discussed in the previous part, this context from the Russian narrative perspective is filled with fakes, insincerity, evil powers that spread chaos around the world, or incompetent partners. However, in such a context, the Russian narrative of its interaction with this world proves to not be based exclusively on conflict. Instead, two main elements of the diplomatic narrative Russian media and officials have been advocating since the very beginning of operation are “openness to cooperation” and “return to international norms of law.” In the following part, these narratives will be presented and analyzed in terms of their connection with the Russian self – revealed previously.
3.1 Russian openness towards cooperation
For a country that considers itself to be the bearer of truth in a world of fakes, Russia has been, to a certain extent, counter intuitively open towards cooperation in Syria and eager to emphasize that even the decision to intervene has not been taken in a context of isolation.
The first part in a “Russian openness” narrative regards Russian diplomatic activity. During September 27th, a broadcast show runner listed the diplomatic activity of the Russian president for 5 minutes straight, which might have been connected with the Russian decision to intervene. The way it was presented, one event quickly after another, leaves no doubt that it was important to show how Russian intervention is connected with diplomatic influence and connectedness with other countries that Russia has. Characteristic of this is the interpretation of one of the calls between Vladimir Putin and Barack Obama: “Obama calls Putin, again, - done with the isolation” (VN, 27/09/2015, 6:41). Further, in the same report, Russian-American contact has been highlighted again: “meeting with Obama, whom we did not have to ask for it, is in Putin’s schedule” (VN, 27/09/2015, 16:05).
The second element of an “openness narrative” has been a repeating theme throughout the period of observation – Russian eagerness to cooperate with the USA in
34

particular. On October 4th, 2015 it was claimed that “our [Russian] and American positions became closer – this is good” (VN, 4/10/2015, 14:01). The following week, the Russian deputy minister of defense was cited as saying: “let us [Russian and US military] stop talking through media, let us sit together and solve the problem that we are facing” (VN, 4/10/2015, 20:50) with a show runner lamenting, “we invite Americans to coordinate our efforts, however they refuse and risk finding themselves in isolation” (20:50), “we are open for coordinated work and it is time to join us” (VN, 4/10/2015, 31:04). The week after this, the main report from Syria had a title “Russia and the USA – moment of truth” reiterating that “Russia calls the USA to unite the efforts in order to find the political solution to conflict in Syria” (VN, 11/10/2015, 13:49). Later, Dmitrii Kisilev claimed, “Syria can become a model for cooperation in other cases” (VN, 11/10/2015, 43:11). On the 15th of November, the same hope was expressed, “can we do it [defeat ISIS] together?” (VN, 15/11/2015, 15:59), and the same on November 22nd, “will a joint response to ISIS threat emerge”? (VN, 22/11/20150:11). However, for the following two months this narrative had altogether disappeared. It seemed that what Russia wanted the most was an alliance, or at least friendly cooperation with the USA. However, it was not happening, and the explanation for the failure of this cooperation is of a very particular kind, according to Russian media.
As it was discussed previously, the general image of the USA in the Russian narrative is one of the “chaotic force that spreads destruction.” With such a force it would be unreasonable to seek cooperation, but not according to Russian media. What is blocking cooperation at this time is not the spread of chaos on its own, but the way these actions are performed – from the position of an actor that has a moral right to do so without considering the Russian opinion on matters in question. In fact, parallel to the calls for cooperation, the Russian narrative highlights what is wrong in American behavior. Some of the most characteristic examples are as such: “we cannot accept the ‘chosen’ character of American politics” (VN, 4/10/2015, 28:39), “Obama, who once called Americans the chosen nation, now is not even able to formulate the goals of his policy” (VN, 18/10/15, 16:35), “we cannot have a dialog with the politics based on the idea of being chosen” (VN, 25/10/2015, 43:11).
35

According to Russian interpretation, such exclusiveness means the ability to act with no constraints; to act by breaking the “rules of the game.” Instead, Russia must act in the world where there is a need to “return in the framework of international law those actors who are used to the fact that only they create the rules” (VN, 25/10/2015, 20:88). Before Russia interfered in Syria, “Americans were used to the world where they can afford to break agreements without any consequences, refuse to negotiate, destroy countries, lie in the Security Council” (VN, 25/10/2015, 21:11). This is the main reason behind any Russian-American conflict according to Russian media, “Putin does not allow [the USA] to destroy countries … prevents the USA from controlling the world, because he himself is not giving up” (VN, 31/01/16, 14:55).
Within Russian discourse, the “rules of the game” are connected with international law, or at least with the way Russia understands it: “[we support] the idea of the common rules of the game, commitment to what international law is” (VN, 4/10/2015, 28:55). It was highlighted on several occasions in Russian media that, in contrast to the US-led coalition, the one lead by Russia acts within legal constraints For example: “Putin’s actions are in perfect compliance with Russian and international law” (VN, 4/10/2015, 9:22); “the moral and legal purity of our decisions” (VN, 4/10/2015, 11:29); “[Americans can join us] in order to make their actions legal” (VN, 11/10/2015, 31:04).
A clear direction toward dialog with the USA in the Russian narrative returned with new strength in February 2016, a month before the first “end” of Russian intervention occured. On the 14th of February, a primary report from Syria was titled “Russia – the USA: looking for solution.” According to Russian media, it became possible because Russian status in the eyes of the USA had changed. In particular, the “[Americans] themselves decided to interact with Russia as with a real power, because all other alternatives have failed” (VN, 14/02/2016, 13:59). A status changed occurred at this time, though not because the USA believed in Russia’s superior moral position, but because Russian actions were effective. “We [Russia] achieved progress both in the fight against terrorist and in finding common ground with the USA … obviously these two things are connected with each other” (VN, 14/02/2016, 13:5916:11), “already in October, right after the launch of Russian operations in Syria, Putin suggested coordination between the Russian and American militaries – the American side has
36

been resisting, but now in view of the risk of a big war and clear successes of Russia, they had to sit with us in front of the military maps” (VN, 28/02/2016, 12:46). But Russian success was not only on the battle ground and, for the following three minutes, the report presented a non-stop stream of phone calls and negotiations on Syria matter happened with Russian participation, which a show-runner labeling it as a “diplomatic push” and “diplomatic marathon.” Summarizing this push, the Russian media claims: “we had to achieve the moment when joint actions with the USA become possible … we had to persuade Americans not only through negotiations” (VN, 28/02/2016, 21:21). Moreover, while discussing joint Russian-American action, the Russian narrative goes as far as labeling “American crimes” in Iraq, Libya as calmly for Russian narrative as possible, as “deeds of the past – experience” (VN, 14/02/2016, 15:51).
While summarizing the role and place of the USA in the Russian narrative of Syrian intervention, the following logic emerges. From the very beginning, Russia wanted common rules that would guide the policies of all countries, however the existing rules would not work due to the American exceptionalism. In such a world, the only thing left for Russia is to support its position by force and, instead of good will, “force” is working.
3.2 “Reasonable force” The idea of “working force” in its connection with international norms is the
final constitutive part of the “diplomatic” portion of the Russian narrative regarding the Syrian civil war. Such a force is the continuation of Russian understanding of itself, as discussed previously. Being the power that protects, is honest, and is capable of dealing with global threats, Russia offers rules for the game, which, from its perspective, are alternative to American.
The key difference is the supposed inclusion of all parties interested in a problem – not through actions themselves but through way of acting. In fact, the conflict “inclusion” vs. “exclusion” can be traced through most of the reports. The Russian intervention happened after “we listened to everybody and took into account the interests of all parties involved” (VN, 4/10/2015, 9:30). In contrast to the USA,
37

according to the Russian president, “we were not warned by anybody [about the start of anti-ISIS operations of the US], but we did it” (VN, 11/10/2015, 30:55). As the result of Russian actions, “the world, which was slipping into chaos, became more balanced and therefore safe” (VN, 25/10/2015, 21:35).
Here, one can find reference to the oppositions of “honesty vs. hypocrisy” and “chaos vs. order,” both crucial for defining the Russian self. Indeed, while investigating the Russian narrative, one can often create an image that Russia is against any global and international element of modern world. However, it appears to be more complicated. Russia is not against global trends, rather it is only against those that ignore what is called within its narrative the “traditional way of life.” In that respect, the Russian approach resists such global processes as democratization (Arab spring) and rapid social changes connected with it (progressive agenda of LGBT-rights, etc) while instead seeking a more dispersed global community where different “way of lives” can coexist with no one being given moral superiority. Attempts to promote the first approach are never fruitful and only lead to chaos and are therefore “irresponsible” and evil. The only alternative to it, from a Russian perspective, is communication between different ways of thinking, and this approach is the one Russia offers to the world.
Furthermore, according to the Russian narrative, the only way to defeat ISIS is through genuine international cooperation. This narrative can also be traced through the entire period of observation: “humanitarian catastrophe can be stopped only if the whole world unites” (VN, 13/09/2015, 28:31), “our goal is to unite efforts in the fight against a common enemy” (VN, 27/09/2015, 11:41) etc. What is clear from these calls is the way Russian leadership understands conflict and terrorism – as an opportunity to cooperate.
In sum, the “diplomatic narratives” of Russian intervention in Syria are essentially connected with “ethical” ones. These narratives show how the Russian “self” is capable of communicating with the others. What is crucial, from the perspective of the thesis, is the element of supposed openness in the narrative. A desire to be talked to and desire to be seen is not typically the goal of a nation that seeks to become domestically as closed from Western influence as possible. In the concluding part of this chapter, the revealed narrative and oppositions will be summarized to enable easier analysis of the revealed narrative, not just from the perspective observed in Russian

media, but in a broader context of other events that happened before and after Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war.

As it follows from the table, it is difficult to define one purpose of Russian intervention in Syria even from within the Russian narrative. The dispersion between

40

the goals and the possibility to achieve them in principle is striking. However, it is important to point out that within this discourse, any Russian actions can be explained as a step towards one goal or the other.
What is the most difficult to define is the potential ethical goals of Russian intervention. Therefore, in the table there are question marks next to each suggested aim. A certain paradox appears. On the one hand, based on the frequency of references towards ethical considerations, as well as its central place in the narrative, it is clearly a crucial element in the Russian narrative of intervention in Syria. On the other hand, based on the data openly presented in Russian media, it is hard to tell what Russia wants from its action. What could be a tangible result that would satisfy Russian leadership?
Finally, it is clear even from the Russian narrative itself that intervention in Syria was, for the most part, not about Syria. One can accept that Russia genuinely wanted to stop ISIS and help Bashar Assad, though several times Russian leadership expressed readiness to accept free democratic elections in Syria after the terrorist threat will be eradicated –most notably in the statement on this account made in 2012 by Russian Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov (which was never revoked). However, even in that case, other considerations of its relationship with the West are more important to Russian leadership. From that perspective, problems in Syria serve as context for more general arguments that Russia has with the current system.
Consequently, to get a deeper understanding of what meaning the intervention in Syria had for Russian leadership in 2015, one has to go deeper into descriptive analysis. In the next chapter, the revealed findings will be analyzed in the context of existing literature on Russian foreign policy and Russian identity in its relations to foreign policy decisions.

Chapter III. Russian Narrative in context
In the previous chapter, the Russian narrative of intervention in the Syrian civil war has been analyzed exclusively from its own perspective. In this part of the thesis, the same narrative will be considered in the context of existing literature as well as theories of international relations. The ultimate goal of this chapter is to understand what the conducted analysis can add to the existing research and, consequently, how it can broaden understanding of the motivation behind Russian foreign policy.
Realist considerations In terms of international relations theories, one potential interpretation of the
revealed narrative is the treatment of a Russian legitimation campaign as a rhetorical action. The Institute for the Study of War – a nongovernmental American think tank – has been tracking all Russian airstrikes in Syria and have revealed that the absolute majority of them was directed, not against ISIS, but against the armed Syrian opposition. From the perspective of the Institute, this gap between claimed policies and real actions can be explained in the following way: “The Kremlin framed its intervention in Syria as a response to the growing threat posed by ISIS, recognizing that the terrorist group posed a joint threat to Russia and the West. This false yet plausible narrative allowed Russia to curtail the West’s ability to unite against Russia’s efforts to bolster President Assad and project military force in the Middle East…Moscow’s decision to disguise its intervention in Syria as a response to ISIS is an example of the Russian doctrine of reflexive control: the use of disinformation to alter an opponent’s perception of events and lead the adversary to respond in a manner that ultimately favors Russia” (Institute for the Study of War, 2015). Another realist explanation suggests: “Russia’s deployment of military might to Syria is a tactical move to protect its client and ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad” (Covington, 2015). What is more, the demonstration of power in Syria is nothing else but an attempt to deter western influence in the Middle East and impede the security system that has been built in the region by the USA and its allies – an idea that has been expressed by Angela Stent, for
42

example, “The Syrian gambit is thus part of a broader move to recoup Russian influence in the Middle East” (Stent, 2016).
It is hard to argue, based on the revealed narrative, that Russia intended to save Bashar Assad. However, it is equally important that the motivation behind this protection was to save Russia’s client. In the Russian framework, Assad’s regime was worth saving only because it was fighting against absolute evil, supported by Western puppet masters. Consequently, this reasoning is based more on ethical considerations and not just on geo-political gambits. Moreover, should one remain within the realist logic, even more questions emerge. For example, if, for Russia, the support of Bashar Assad’s regime is so important, then why did Russia not voice any concrete commitment towards keeping Assad in power should the pro-governmental forces win the war in Syria?
At the same time, if fighting against ISIS was so important to Russia as it claimed, then the level of its unpreparedness during the first six months of the operation puts the sincerity of these claims into question. For example, once, right after the start of military operation, Vladimir Putin claimed ""we make no difference between Sunnies and Shias"" (BBC, 2015). Additionally, a second statement was made during a pressconference in December 2015, a month after Turkey shot down a Russian jet that violated its airspace while bombing the positions of local militia supported by Turkey (since they were Turcoman people – ethnically related to Turks). The Russian president had only the comment, “you know, we did not know a thing about so-called Turcoman. I know about Turkmen people, our dear Turkmen people, living in Turkmenistan, and here we do not understand a thing [PS] nobody told us a thing” (Putin, 2015).
It proves even more complicated within the realist paradigm to explain the element of “openness for cooperation with the West and the USA,” while also portraying the USA as the reason behind the emergence of this global evil – ISIS. Moreover, this duality is a re-occurring theme in the relationship between Russia and the West: “why does Russia use such strong language as presenting Western nations at one time as “brothers” and “friends,” while at other times castigating them for “betraying” the established principles and agreements?” (Tsygankov, 2014, 347). From a data perspective, while analyzing the Syrian intervention narrative present in media, it is revealed that this duality is the crucial element of the Russian understanding of the
43

conflict in Syria and global politics in general. Therefore, it cannot be dismissed as a mere propaganda tool as political realism would suggest. Alternative explanations must be found, particularly within other approaches to international relations which analyze the importance of “identity” and “self” and how it correlates with the image discovered previously through the analysis of primary data.
Social constructivism on the Russian “self” and “being right” in international relations
The most common premise concerning Russian foreign policy post-cold war is the assumption that its primary focus has been the restoration of the country’s influence and status in international affairs (Kanet, 2007; Trenin, 2011; Tsygankov, 2005, Stent, 2014). However, any issue of status is an issue of symbolic communication, and Russia is a paradox from this perspective. According to Volgy et al., Russia constitutes a unique category, being a country that believes itself to be a great power without all the capacities of one. What is special about Russia is that, in contrast to other overachieving status-inconsistent countries that are afraid of losing this status and tend not to take high-risk action (Volgy et al., 2011, p.11-12), Russia clearly conducts highly confrontational foreign policy, being constantly involved in armed conflicts as of 2014, and having previous involvement even in 2008.
To begin with, under Vladimir Putin, symbolic politics in Russia’s foreign policy agenda have become a central pillar, putting issues of security or the economy aside (Forseberg, Heller, Wolf, 2013). Moreover, many scholars consider the lack of status recognition and respect from the partner-countries to be one of the main reasons of crisis in Russia-West relations, which results in the current crisis of trust (Monaghan, 2008; Sakwa, 2008; Stent, 2014; Tsygankov, 2012). Before the crisis in Ukraine, Vincent Pouliot proposed that “if NATO wants Russia to play by the rules of the security-from-the-inside-out game, it should provide enough cultural-symbolic resources to have a minimally successful hand in the game” (Pouliot, 2010, p. 239). Furthermore, as Jeffrey Mankoff argues “a Russia that is sure of itself and its standing in the world is likely to make a more stable, predictable partner for the West” (Mankoff, 2007, p. 133). Such an importance attached to the West is not coincidental. As Ted
44

Hopf argues, identities are always relational and “the Self and the Other are mutually necessary…identities can only be understood relationally, we can not know what an identity is without relating it to another” (Hopf, 2002). In the context of war this also means that, before a nation resorts to violence in order to protect certain values or defend certain interests, it has to build an image of what those interests are. And such an understanding emerges only as a result of interaction with others or reflections on the previous experiences of such an interaction.
Generally in agreement with the statement of Amrosio (“Russia seeks to be respected as a great power because of deep seated beliefs about its own identity and its place in the world” (Ambrosio, 2005, p. viii)), this thesis also suggest looking deeper into the meaning of “being a great power.” Indeed the notion of Great Power is not selfexplanatory, especially in the context of the Russian intervention into the Syrian civil war, and must be conceptualized.
One instrumental definition of a great power is provided by Ivar Neumann: “on the one hand, [great powers] are simply greater in terms of relative resources … and, on the other hand, they are prestigious due to some superior moral quality.” (Neumann, 2008, 131). But, “what is special about modern Russia is that, in contrast to other overachieving status-inconsistent countries that are afraid of losing this status and tend not to take high-risk action,” (Volgy et al., 2011, p.11-12) the “Russian Federation is an overachiever, enjoying a Great power status without having the capabilities of a Great power” (Freire, 2011, p. 74). Therefore, one has to investigate what being a Great Power means to Russia. As noted by Anatoliy Reshetnikov, “if the ideological undertone of the Soviet “great projects” was rather explicit, the current ones seem to be anything but ideologically coherent” (Reshetnikov, 2011, 152). The content of a particular discourse of the Russian “self” in the context of war in Syria, as discussed in the previous chapter, suggests that “honor” is not the best way to define Russian understanding of the “great power” as an element of its identity. Instead, one can see a clear emphasis on what is labeled as “being right/good/honest” and therefore “being great”.
Perhaps the most established, theoretical way to approach the phenomenon of the desire of “being right” can be found in the so-called “logic of appropriateness.” A classical study of the logics of action in international relations can be found in the
45

article of Thomas Risse “‘Let’s Argue!’: Communicative action in World Politics” (Risse, 2000). In his, research Risse defines three logics of action. The first one is the logic of consequence, which “treats the interests, and the preferences of actors as mostly fixed during the process of interaction” (Risse, 2000, 3). Consequently, in this logic of action, “agents participate on the basis of their given identities and interests and try to realize their preferences through strategic behavior” (Risse, 2000, 3). In contrast to the logic of consequences, the logic of appropriateness presumes that: “human actors are imagined to follow rules that associate particular identities to particular situations, approaching individual opportunities for action by asserting similarities between current identities and choice dilemmas and more general concepts of self and situations” (Risse, 2000, 4). In terms of the logic of international relations, appropriateness would also imply following the norms of the international community. And indeed, in the Russian narrative of the intervention in Syria, the importance attached to the idea of “global rules of the game,” as well as anger and disdain towards powers that destroy these rules, is strongly traceable.
Another possible answer to this question is one of honor: “the concept of honor is often at the heart of how a nation expresses its historical experience and formulates a moral purpose in world politics. Honor defines what is a “good” and “virtuous” course of action for a state vis-à-vis other members of international society” (Tsygankov, 2012,20). Ted Hopf highlighted the dependency of “great power” identity on international recognition and hierarchical identity structures (Hopf, 2002, 190).
However, as we’ve seen before, for Russia the norms of international law are valid only as long as Russia is involved in the process of its creation. It is clear that the Russian “desire to be right” cannot be explained by the logic of appropriateness on a level of formal rules-following behavior. What is more, within “being right” in the Russian discourse, morality and legality goes hand in hand. Such a correlation in regards to foreign policy, as well as such a strong belief in what Ivar Neuman would call “superior moral quality” (Neumann, 2008, 131), could not exist within the traditional logic of appropriateness. There should have been a rhetorical model to support such a belief, and this thesis would argue that such a model is the model of a “just war” or even a “holy war.” In the following part of the thesis, the origins of this
46

model will be demonstrated, as well as the parallels and references between the model and the discourse of Russian intervention in Syria.
47

Fight to be right?
Rhetorical model of War War has always been an integral part of Russian identity, but in the 20th century
the historical myth of the Great Patriotic War has become “the most important component in defining the identity of the Soviet peoples” (Uldricks, 2009, 60). This war can be considered an equivalent to moral purpose and is essential for a community’s existence (Reus-Smit, 2009). What is more, the way the Great Patriotic war is constructed in modern Russia differs from other countries.
In particular, the Russian mainstream avoids talking about the period of 19391941 before the German invasion due to the problematic issue of Soviet-German cooperation during this period. Therefore, the main adjective for the German invasion is “sudden” and “traitorous” as if it appeared out of nothing as a force of nature. Moreover, WWII is basically considered in Russian society (its mainstream) as a ""sacred value"" (Baron, Spranca, 1997; Atran, 2010; Durkheim, 1912, 1995), the acceptance of which by the third party constitutes clear distinction in the ""friendenemy"" dichotomy in which Russian people conceptualize modern internal and external political life. Furthermore, WWII possesses absolute moral value precisely because of its essence – the salvation of millions of lives of innocent people from extermination in concentration camps.
At the same time, civilian suffering during WWII allowed the Russian Great Patriotic War narrative to label any attempt to discuss the problem of post-war occupation of Eastern Europe, or Soviet Union responsibility for the conflict, as a means to rehabilitate Nazism. In that sense, Eastern European nations existed only to be saved by the red army, with no agency of its own. In a summarized way, the chain of metaphors of the Great Patriotic War are: “an evil force has come out of nowhere from outside into some territory – civilians are suffering in this territory – Russia appears and saves the day no matter how much the West damages its efforts”.
From this discourse a very particular image of war can be derived. First and foremost, the language of war in Russia is not the language of national interest discourse that follows a utilitarian logic of consequence, but instead is the language of justice and truth – the language of the logic of appropriateness. Furthermore, war, the way Russia interprets it, has a very particular value – it allows the country to do
48

something that is morally good and right. And, finally, by being good in a “holy war,” the Russian discursive model manages to prevent the discussion or criticism of the “dark pages” of Russian history and politics.
In many ways the revealed discursive model of the Russian intervention in Syria correlates with the model of a “holy war” as discussed above. Russia acts as a savior of innocent Syrian people, who are threatened by the force of chaos – terrorism. Such behavior is of “unprecedented moral and legal purity” (VN, 4/10/2015, 9:44). Moreover, there were direct references to the experience of WWII in the reports: the “current coalition is an anti-Hitler one” (VN, 4/10/2015, 30:50). Russian actions in Syria have repeatedly been described as just, honest, and pure with Russia being “good” fighting against “evil”. And following this discursive framework of a “holy war,” evil simply must exist so that Russia can fight it and to be praised for it.
Again, it is easy to label the Russian war narrative as a mere disinformation method, however the Russian elite and society may in fact share the belief that it is through a “just war” that Russia manifests its moral superiority. If a “just war” narrative and desire to be morally strong is what stands behind Russian aggressive behavior, then it is possible to make several conclusions about the way Russia sees itself in the international system and the system itself.
The narrative of a just war being considered as having real value beyond simple propaganda can provide an alternative insight into the objectives of Russian foreign policy. One crucial problem for Russia is international recognition in a form that Russia considers acceptable. Further investigation is required to understand what was missing in Russian-West relations during the first two of Putin’s presidencies. It is clear that Russia does not necessarily want to follow the rules, and instead wants to set them. However, this desire to be constitutive of the post-cold war order as a whole is precisely one of the properties of the Great power that Russia considers itself to be.
Ted Hopf has pointed out that, on the international level, to be a great power means to comply with a “set of oughts and ought nots” while dealing with other countries. And from the Russian perspective, this set of rules may include the right to wage “just wars” even against a background of condemnation from the international community. In fact, going beyond the established set of rules and having the ability to establish and interpret them in a convenient way is the definitive feature of great power
49

in the current international order, as the only true great power (from the Russian perspective), the USA, did in Iraq, Kosovo, and Ukraine. Even in 2002 Hopf argued that “the only external force capable of affecting Russian discourse in the nearest future after 1999 is US unilateralism” (Hopf, 2002, 269), and apparently such an effect did take place.
What can help to understand the mechanism of the problem between Russia and the West is the work of Janice Mattern, which is focused on the mechanisms that enable the functioning of a security community – a group of states that can trust each other to not use force to settle disputes between them (Mattern, 2001, p.349). In contrast to other security community theorists, like Karl Deutsch and Adler and Barnett, who were interested in whether or not security communities exist, Mattern is focused on the question of how they work. She is not satisfied with an explanation that power plays a minor role in a security community, being substituted by a “we-identity”. For Mattern, one the key properties of a security community is still power and force – not physical, but rather representational. Mattern points out that security communities function through language, with the power to define the content of “we-identity” being no less strong than that of physical force. Identity formation entails oppression and power: the “authority to determine what to include and exclude from the “we” by conferring, deterring or denying the relevance of certain knowledge to the community” (Mattern, 2001, p.354). This representational force is no less powerful or mentally painful for an object who is threatened to be excluded from such a “we-community.” In other words, “the forceful power is not excluded from the security community – nor by extension from any regime dependent upon identity” (Mattern, 2001, p. 387).

Two logics of international As revealed in the previous chapter, throughout all discourse of the intervention
in Syria, Russian media has been emphasizing the honesty of Russian politics in contrast to Western politics. Consequently, one can interpret the key problem in Russia’s relationship with the West, from the Russian perspective, as the problem of dialog. In short, Russia seeks to be understood by the West for what it is, and to get what it deserves. The discursive model of a “just war” helps to understand what kind of dialogue Russia seeks with the West.
Indeed, if praise and acceptance is what Russia seeks to achieve, there should be a non-evil “other” that could praise Russia for its noble deeds. Within the Russian narrative of the intervention in Syria such an “other” exists – Europe. A Europe that is incapable of solving its problems on its own; incapable of protecting itself. As Dmitrii Kisiliov claimed in October 2015, right after the operation began, “for the fourth time in its history Russia saves Europe from enslavement and barbarism: Mongols, Napoleon, Hitler, ISIS” (VN, 4/10/2015, 31:08). Consequently, Russian foreign politics is narratively rooted in the desire to be praised by the international community in general and the West in particular. However, what the analysis of the Syrian intervention discourse reveals is that Russian leadership understands this praise and respect in a very particular way.
As part of the “order against chaos” narrative, the collocation of a “traditional way of life” has been used multiple times: the “Arab spring has destroyed the traditional way of life in the region” (VN, 28/06/2015, 16:50); “the USA has acted without responsibility, destroying countries and the way of life of entire regions” (VN, 13/12/15, 13:16) etc. In the framework of the discussed narrative this “way of life” should be read as Russian opposition towards a globalist understanding of “international,” which Russian discourse traditionally has associated with the USA, European Union, and the whole discourse around “human rights.”
The rejection of any revolution against a legitimate government has been the cornerstone of Russian arguments with its Western partners for a decade. In fact, “the consequences of Color Revolutions were regarded by the Russian elite as the result of the United States' and the EU's foreign policies” (Gretskiy et al., 2014, 382). In February 2011, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev talking about the Arab Spring
51

revolutions explained them as being “instigated by outside forces” and warned: “Let's face the truth. They [the West] have been preparing such a scenario for us [Russia], and now they will try even harder to implement it” (Freedman, 2011). In 2014, during a meeting with his advisory Security Council, Vladimir Putin stated: ""We see what tragic consequences the wave of so-called color revolutions led to… for us, this is a lesson and a warning. We should do everything necessary so that nothing similar ever happens in Russia"" (Reuters. 2014).
Here lies a certain paradox. Within its own discourse, and while talking to an international audience, Russia always presents itself as a true proponent of international cooperation and international law, while strongly resisting any unilateralism. As it was revealed before, Russia highlights the legality of its presence in Syria, and through it Russian loyalty to the system of international law. However, within the very same discourse, Russia strongly opposes any truly global and transnational processes. From the Russian perspective, this logic is strongly associated with the idea of liberal values, which Russia regards as hypocrisy. One characteristic example that helps to illustrate this idea is the Russian media’s reaction towards Barack Obama’s speech to the United Nation Security council on September 29th. In particular, the American president expressed a dream of a world in which any girl anywhere can go to school. This quite innocent proposition had provoked an outbreak of nothing short of rage from Dmitrii Kisiliev: “the USA has entered the Middle East, destabilized it [Arab spring], left chaos and left … but Obama tells us about girls that should go to school. They should but it is not for Obama to bring them there using such means” (VN, 04/10/2015, 34:48). Against this background, Vladimir Putin in his speech in the UN, and Dmitrii Kisiliev in his show, have referenced multiple times what can be called Russian preferences: “bringing back order to the Middle East” (VN, 04/10/2015, 31:20); “support state institutions where they are left” (VN, 04/10/2015, 32:24); and “we can only pity states and peoples which were penetrated by the USA” (VN, 04/10/2015, 26:35).
Consequently, it appears that for the Russian leadership, ‘international’ means space that exists as a space between independent units – states. This space is regulated by a certain set of norms or “rules of the game,” and these rules are the subject of dialog and communication between these units. What Russia is truly against is the opposite logic of ‘international,’ which understands it as the space of transnational processes,
52

universal in its nature. As something that, in principle, goes beyond the state logic. For Russia, global processes and international process are two different things, with global process being a subject of control of any state within its own territory. Within the Russian paradigm, such things as “universal standards,” be it education, healthcare, LGBT-rights, or terrorism, do not exist. Or at least they exist only on a country level, with no international dimension.
Therefore, within the Russian narrative, the universal logic of ‘international,’ as represented in 2015 by Barack Obama, is an ultimate enemy since it attempts to promote a liberal worldview as the only one morally acceptable, and this promotion is the basis for the international politics of the USA. Whereas for Russia, ‘international’ means an area where different worldviews, or “traditional ways of life” (as it appears in Syrian intervention discourse) are in dialog with each other. In other words, for Russia ‘international’ being understood as the sum of parts (states) does not result in a new entity bigger than this sum.
However, another problem then appears for Russia from within this logic. While not necessarily seeking conflict with the opposing logic, Russia still sees the international arena as a sphere of communication and, consequently, one can say the Russian leadership indeed seeks dialog with its partners. However, it wants to be a moral equal in this dialog, rather than a student who is taught the “right” way of life. Even more, Russia wants to be seen in this dialogue by the significant other the same way Russia sees itself. As was discussed previously, this is the image of “savior,” of a strong and good and therefore “right” power.
What is more such an innate understanding of international and war appears to be shared by Russian people and elite alike. According to polls conducted in March 2015, 47% of Russian respondents preferred that the country be a great power which they conceptualize as one “respected and afraid of,” for the sake of the country’s economic well-being2. Even against the background of a deepening economic crisis in January 2016 36% of the population considered Russia to be a great power in the world,
2 Levada Center. Press-release “Positions of the Russian Federation on International Arena” (March, 23. 2015) Accessed 10th March, 2016 from http://www.levada.ru/old/23-03-2015/pozitsii-rossii-namezhdunarodnoi-arene
53

compared with 27% in 20153. As I argued in my article “The fact is that, from the perspective of at least 30% of the Russian population, Russia being considered an enemy by most developed countries does not weaken their pride for the motherland but instead strengthens it. Even admitting that the country is economically weak compared with the West, people are proud that at least in terms of foreign policy capacities, Russia seems to be on equal footing” (Shchelin, 2016).
Apparently, great powerness can be considered as one of the fundamental political myth of Russian society. Political myths are common in all modern countries (Smith, 1991; Hosking & Schöpflin, 1997) since they are the means to keep nations together, however not an every political myth is based on an idea of great power as it is in Russian case. As Hanna Smith (Smith, 2014, 361) argues “national unity had given a boost to Russian self-confidence and Russian great power identity had found its place in Russian domestic discourse”.
Here it is possible to argue that Syria as another “just war” served as means for the Russian state to preserve the image of the country in the eyes of Russian citizens. Indeed, one of the primary social functions of war in the state of Modern to be the ultimate means of State visibility. This is the function of war usually forgotten, but in the Westphalia system of modern states it is in part through war how a modern state has prevailed over previous forms of government. The creation of massive armies where all soldiers, no matter the social class, were melted into a single body was one the key social mechanisms of the creation of the “imagined communities” of modern nations. War and the possibility of total war, such as WWI and WWII – that involves not only those who serve in the army but every citizen – has resulted in multiple social practices that permanently reinforce the coherence of the “nation-state” construct and allowing the suppression of the differences between the groups and community that otherwise would not be held together. Paraphrasing Charles Tilly’s statement – the modern state needs war but modern war does not need a modern state. On the contrary, an international disdain towards war as a political practice is a new phenomenon for a modern state. In fact, war used to be generally understood by policymakers in the way

54

Barkawi and Brighton state (Barkawi, Brighton, 2011, 126) “war is a generative force like no other. It is of fundamental significance for politics, society and culture ... War, the threat of war and the preparation for war mark the origins, transformation, and end of polities.” Moreover, as Jens Bartelson points out: “from the seventeenth to the early twentieth century, war has been saddled with an almost magical capacity to produce sociopolitical order out of its manifold negations, and has been involved in the shaping of actors and in the drawing of the boundaries separating them” (Bartelson, 2016).
Such an understanding of war fits into the proposed concept of “just war” revealed during the analysis of the Russian narrative of intervention in Syria. Russian leadership clearly sees force and power as a visible mechanism in dialog both in the space of international communication, as well as during the process of presentation of Russia to Russian citizens – keeping Russian “imagined community” coherent. Indeed, as John Hutchinson points out “wars have significance when the experiences of conflict generate profound ideological-cultural cleavages and through their outcomes change the balance of power between rival conceptions of the nation” (Hutchinson, 2017, 49).
Summing up, one can read Russian actions exclusively from within the logic of competition between great powers: they “sent strategic bombers on sorties over the country from bases in central Russia, and ordered the Russian navy to fire missiles at Syrian targets from positions in the Caspian and Mediterranean Seas. By doing so, Russia undermined the de facto monopoly on the global use of force that the United States has held since the collapse of the Soviet Union” (Trenin, 2016). In contrast, however, the very same action can also be read as an attempt to act accordingly to what one partner in the dialogue expects from an equal. It is not a coincidence that the opposition of “honesty vs. fake” is so vivid in Russian discourse of the Syrian intervention. Within the Russian discourse, the “global use of power” that Dmitrii Trenin writes about is not referring to interests, but instead refers to equality during communication practices. Russian resentment towards the current world order is not simply a result of feeling that some of its interest have been attacked, but because “they lied to us” (VN, 18/10/2015, 25:30). The USA is not Russia’s enemy, but it becomes one when there is “refusal to form a direct dialogue” (VN, 18/10/2015, 19:08) - one can add “dialogue with respect and as with an equal.”

Against such a background, the Syrian intervention and war in general acquires a very particular meaning. The Syrian intervention becomes an example of a “just war,” in which the main function is communicative. It is a certain kind of language used to remind Europe what Russia is from the Russian perspective, and to demand from Europe an adequate dialogue. War, therefore, is turned into a performance. Its function– to present oneself the way one perceives oneself, and to get the recognition one thinks one deserves unconditionally just for being.
Social function of war The proposed interpretation of the Russian intervention in Syria primarily helps
to understand the paradox of the gap between Russian rhetoric and Russian actions during the first stage of the operation. If the logic behind the decision is one centered around the desire to “feel being right,” one can expect poor preparation of the operation from the perspective of the analysis of such a complex international phenomenon as the Syrian civil war. For example, if Russia really wanted to cooperate with the West and the USA over Syria in order to break its isolation after the war in Ukraine, then it should have shown commitment to the fight against ISIS and have proved its military capacities to win in this fight. This would have been the most reasonable and logical way to persuade Western partners. However, as it was shown by the Institute for the Study of War, during the first stage of Russian intervention, ISIS positions remained mostly untouched by Russian airstrikes despite the claims of Russian diplomats. US officials also estimated that only 10-30% of Russian airstrikes targeted ISIS (Guardian, 2015). In fact, an air strike is not the kind of data that is easily hidden and would be more reasonable for Russian authorities to be consistent with, should they desire partnership with the USA. Moreover, the way the Russian military interfered in the Syrian conflict has resulted in little help on the ground for the Assad regime during first 6 months of Russian involvement. Neither was the stability of the governmental regime promoted nor were terrorists' bases destroyed. Several operations inspired by the desire to create an image of success have lead to severe losses in other areas. One can treat this gap as an intentional deliberation, but at the same time it can be simply a sign of Russian unpreparedness. In short, Russia, following a logic that is not understood by the international community, has entered into a conflict where the interests of so many
56

actors are complexly intertwined. It has proven that the Russian army and Russian diplomacy was not and is not prepared to act in such an environment; that is why Russia keeps performing ad hoc policy without any strategic military reasoning.
From the perspective of this thesis, what is even more important in this case is the way the social function of war has been changing in the Russian discourse of Syrian intervention. Instead of military aspects with battle plans and clear objectives, a performative element of warfare has entered the forefront. War instead has become the means to express one’s identity. The Russian intervention in Syria, within the Russian discourse, becomes a virtual war in the same way as Jean Baudrillard wrote of the Gulf war, meaning that with the help of virtual technologies the Gulf War had become a purely virtual war: “so war, when it has been turned into information, ceases to be a realistic war and becomes a virtual war, in some way symptomatic […] everything which is turned into information becomes the object of endless speculation, the site of total uncertainty” (Baudrillard 2001, 242). Paul Virilio shows that modern means of warfare: heat-seeking missiles, infra-red and laser guidance systems, warheads fitted with video cameras, are also a means of representation that marks “the complete evaporation of visual subjectivity into an ambient technical effect, a sort of permanent pan cinema. Which, unbeknown to us, turns our most ordinary acts into movie action, into new visual material, undaunted, undifferentiated vision-fodder… [of which the main aim is] a waning of reality: an aesthetics of disappearance…” (Virilio 1994, 47, 49).
This observation is closely connected with the discoveries of literature on such an element of modern warfare as media spectacle. It originates from political philosophy – in particular in the writings of Paul Virilio, Douglas Kellner, and Jean Baudrillard (Virilio, 2000, Kellner, 2003; Baudrillard, 2009) and presumes that with the development of military and television technologies, the reality of war has become separated from its image, turning armed conflicts into media spectacle solely designed for political ends. Chouliaraki has shown (Chouliaraki, 2006, 2013) how the performative function of the spectacle of war is intentionally oriented towards certain publics to make them (re)constitute themselves as the result of such exposure. Contemporary media has created a new dimension to how audiences perceive wars by making war reality so televised through the graphic quality of live broadcasting, that it
57

almost appears as though it is happening at home, even though the conflict is thousands of miles away. Real-time bombings and invasions are part of the media routine nowadays, often resembling a high-definition computer game (Lenoir, 2000). The logic of screen displays has become an integral part of terrorist propaganda (Silverstone, 2007: 27).
Indeed, war can be understood as the mechanism of communication, particularly that of strategic communication, which some analyze as ‘population-centric wars’– aimed at winning the popular support of the people of a country the war is conducted against (Butler, 2009; Holmqvist, 2013). Or, as it was explained by Richard Falk, “[there is a] scissors effect operating, between public pressure ‘to do something’ produced by media exposure to human wrongs, and the dominant realist predilection of states to ‘keep out’ unless vital interests are at stake.” The result is that “you get shallow intervention and a ‘politics of gesture’ rather than any intervention of a transformative nature…. the politics of gesture means that you do something, but you do something that does not involve big risks.” (Der Derian, 2009, p. 72). Such an international disdain towards war as a political practice is a new phenomenon for a modern state. In fact, war used to be generally understood by policymakers in the way Barkawi and Brighton state, “war is a generative force like no other. It is of fundamental significance for politics, society and culture ... War, the threat of war and the preparation for war mark the origins, transformation, and end of polities” (Barkawi, Brighton, 2011, 126). Moreover, as Jens Bartelson points out, “from the seventeenth to the early twentieth century, war has been saddled with an almost magical capacity to produce sociopolitical order out of its manifold negations, and has been involved in the shaping of actors and in the drawing of the boundaries separating them” (Bartelson, 2016).
What is more, as has been discussed in the research puzzle, the fields of perception of modern war (Virilio, 1988) has changed as well due to technological developments in warfare itself. It is interesting that, from Virilio’s perspective, this substitution of military reality as something anchored in ‘a place’ began long ago: “in the thirties, it was already clear that film was superimposing itself on a geostrategy which, for a century or more, had inexorably been leading to the direct substitution, and thus sooner or later the disintegration, of things and places” (Virilio, 1988, 47). However, advanced modern warfare has reached levels of virtuality previously
58

unimaginable for military theorists. As a result, the spatial dimension of war is disappearing for the military and political leaders of militarily developed nations, depriving the popular conscription army system of its military purpose since, instead of millions of soldiers, modern warfare depends on technological advantages.
Summing up, nowadays more than ever the symbolic meaning of war, and its performative function, is becoming the center point of the social function of war. The narrative of war legitimation now serves not just some pre-calculated goals but reflects the foundational assumptions about the identity of an actor and more importantly the logic based on which one acts. And in the case of Russia, this logic, and consequently its aims in the Syrian intervention, is neither the rationalist logic of consequence, nor the liberal logic of appropriateness. Instead, one can talk about constructivist logic with war being a means of self-representation to the significant “other.” Being in a just war is connected with being a Great Power since, as it is generally acknowledged to be one, a state requires a combination of military and economic resources in a combination with the attractiveness and recognition by other Great powers (Levy, 1981; Neumann, 2008; Nye, 1990). And it appears that Russian leadership believes that only through recreating the situation of being a “savior” in a war, can it become accepted in a dialogue the way Russia believes it deserves.
Therefore, war, the way Russia interprets it, and the intervention in Syria in particular, has a value of a very particular kind – it allows the country to do a morally good and right thing. Civilians have to die or suffer from the “evil” force somewhere so Russia can save them and by being a “savior” prove that it should be spoken to as an equal, and ideally to stop the process of “globalization” of international relations and prevent them from becoming transcendental. Evil must exist so that Russia can fight it and to be praised for its efforts.
Summing, up the analysis of the Russian narrative of its intervention in the Syrian civil war has revealed several important elements. In particular, it allows an understanding of the problem with seemingly missing “goal” presented in Table 1, when one speaks of “ethical narratives” of intervention developed in Russian media.
It appears that the key global conflict for Russia is between two logics of the ‘international’: “transcendental/global/liberal” and “structured/national.” These logics can not coexist peacefully together unless there is a space for dialogue as well as a way
59

to communicate. Moreover, this problem of co-existence is not one of national interests in a utilitarian way but instead of morality and values. Therefore, it appears that, prior to intervention in Syria, the key problem between the two logics was an absence of communication based on understanding. The Russian leadership, following the narrative, believes to know the “evil” logic behind the USA and the EU policies, whereas the Russian way of thinking and looking upon the world is ignored; promises given to Russia are broken and the country and its leadership are not being treated as morally equal. From this perspective, constant references to the deeds of other powers go beyond a mere propaganda tool, labeled by modern media and scholars as “whataboutism.” Instead, it reflects the Russian leadership’s deepest belief about international relations.
In such a context, the intervention in Syria within the Russian discourse was, to an extent, not at all about Syria. As any human, the Russian leadership desires be in the “right.” But in the current Russian mainstream, the experience of “being right” is built upon the historical experience of World War II as a “just war.” As the result, it is only through recreating this war experience that Russia can fill the emptiness in the gap between how it is seen by the international community and how it sees itself.
One principal question remains, though, and it is the question of time. War in Syria has been raging since 2011, but Russia interfered only in September 2015. To see how the issue of timing has been addressed within the Russian narrative, this thesis will proceed to analyze the data revealed in the place of conflict in Ukraine in the context of Syrian intervention. This will be represented in the closing chapter of the research.
Context of war in Ukraine in the Russian narrative of intervention into Syrian civil war
The conclusions drawn in the previous chapter have discussed the narrative of the war in Syria without referring to the context of another conflict Russia has been involved prior and during it: the war in Eastern Ukraine. In fact, one of the most popular explanations as for the motives behind the Russian intervention in Syria is connected precisely with the international implications of Russian aggression against Ukraine. There are a number of comments that consider Russia’s goal in Syria to be to secure a
60

deal with the United States over Ukraine, and post-Soviet space in general, in exchange for the cooperation of Russia in Syria, possible concessions of Russian influence in the country, or Russia taking on the most difficult role in dealing with ISIS (Nye, 2016; Macfarquhar, 2016; Bodner, 2015). Such an explanation still fits into the realist paradigm, however this in fact answers more questions about the paradoxes of the Russian operation. Firstly, this idea links the Syrian intervention to a broader context of Russian foreign policy during the last 10 years and especially the period post-2014. Secondly, it explains the timing of the operation – after Russian defeat in Ukraine. Thirdly, treating the Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war as a diversion from the conflict in Ukraine makes the eagerness of Russian withdrawal from the conflict in March 2016 far more reasonable.
Therefore, from the perspective of this thesis, it is important to discern how the war in Ukraine was put within the context of the Russian narrative of intervention in Syria. The question in particular is to figure out how the conflict in Ukraine fits into established discursive oppositions, as well as Russia’s supposed desire to be understood and accepted by the West. To figure it out, apart from the discourse analysis, the thesis will also contrast the importance attached to both topics (Syria and Ukraine) over the year prior to and during the intervention in Syria.
First, an important distinction must be made. From the very beginning, the antiUkrainian element on Russian federal television could be subdivided into two narratives: “the war in Ukraine narrative” and “Ukraine as a failing state narrative.” The war narrative embraces the body of ideas that can be summarized under the notions of “a Russian world,” “Novorossia,” “Crimea as a part of Russia,” “Bandera and Faschism,” and any reports about military activity on the territories of so-called “people’s republics.” The ‘Ukraine as a failing state’ narrative focuses on the issues of Ukrainian domestic politics, socio-economic difficulties in the country, political scandals etc. – all information that can create an impression among Russian audience that the neighboring country is on the verge of collapsing. To trace how the usage of these two narratives has been implemented alongside the narrative of the danger of ISIS terrorism and the Russian fight against terrorism in Syria, a more detailed research was required.
61

Therefore, I conducted a discourse analysis of the same dataset of “VestiNedeli” but from a different angle. All Sunday news reports from February 2014 until April 2016 have been analyzed and the share of all three narratives (“the war in Ukraine narrative”, “Ukraine as a failing state narrative” and “fight against terrorism in Syria/ISIS terrorism threat narrative”) in the entire body of the news program has been counted (share of minutes devoted to the narrative/total number of minutes in the news program).
Based on the patterns discovered, it was expected that several time-marks would indicate shifts in the proportions of the Russian propaganda narrative inputs into the public opinion. In particular, the war narrative should dominate in the year 2014, whereas following the signing of the Minsk 2 agreement, “Ukraine as a failing state” should become the primary narrative. Finally, based on chart 2, the “ISIS as a menace” narrative cannot start being enforced into public opinion earlier than August 2015.
The results of this study are presented in the chart below. Chart 1. Share of “war in Ukraine narrative”, “Ukraine as a failing state narrative” and “fight against terrorism in Syria/ISIS terrorism threat narrative” in Vesti-Nedeli news broadcasts
62

A first look at this chart confirms suggestions that the war in Syria could be a socalled “distraction operation.” In March 2015, for the first time, the narrative of “war in Ukraine” stopped being the dominant one in the Sunday news broadcasts. Instead, focus on the events within Ukraine became the what was emphasized. Therefore, it is possible to argue that the Russian elite (not wanting to get rid of the Ukrainian discourse completely as it has become an integral part of Russian TV propaganda), decided to persuade the Russian audience that, despite an absence of clear military victory, the Ukrainian state will eventually return to Russia, being unable to survive on its own. At the same time, the general share of anti-Ukrainian propaganda in Vesti-Nedeli broadcasts dropped dramatically between March 2015 and April 2015: from 42% of screen time to 18,5%. The next relative peak of anti-Ukraine propaganda happened in July 2015 (25%), with the Ukraine-war narrative constituting only 6% of the screen time. After this came a two-month period (August and most of September 2015) in which the Russian public was not subjected to any massive military propaganda: nothing anti-Ukrainian and relatively moderate anti-ISIS. Finally, with the start of the operation in Syria, Russian media became almost entirely focused on it.
However, the development of the shares of coverage of these wars potentially indicates a mere connection between the two, rather than the causal link. Therefore, one must look how Ukraine has been portrayed in the examined Russian media within the narrative of intervention in Syria. Several conclusions can be made based on such analysis.
First, Ukraine has only rarely been referenced to within the context of intervention in Syria. When such references do happen, it was always precisely while talking about the ‘international space.’ The key opposition of “inclusion vs. exclusion” and “honesty vs. dishonesty.” For example, Russian media’s discussion on the contrast between the way Russia was spoken to and the way Ukraine was spoken to during the international summits. In regards to a meeting between Putin and Obama, which happened during the UN general assembly in September 2015, it was highlighted that “Ukraine was not a priority” (VN, 4/10/2015, 32:55) and “Europe got tired of Ukraine” (VN, 4/10/2015, 38:26). Moreover, American policy towards Ukraine was presented as dishonest: “Obama: sex with no responsibilities … what has happened – happened, it
63

was based on mutual agreement and there is no reason to talk about it now” (VN, 4/10/2015, 32:58).
Thus, it is possible to argue that Russian leadership indeed hoped to shift the importance of war in Ukraine aside once the intervention in Syria had begun. However, in the broader picture of Russian discourse this meant not interest-based policy, but instead a policy of restoration of the “true” Russian image. Indeed, after the war in Ukraine, Russia has been viewed globally as a country-aggressor and by no means could be considered a morally right power. Yet the narrative of intervention in Syria indicates how important it is for the country and the government to be treated as Russia deserves. And from the Russian perspective, war in Ukraine has never been unjust. Instead it is the West that breaks all its promises, in particular the agreement with Janukovitch and promoting the coup d’etat – in other words, promoting chaos. The Russian involvement in Ukraine was therefore not an attempt to rebuild the Soviet empire, but to restore order and justice and to be a “savior” again. Instead, Russia has become an international pariah. In other words, the war Ukraine, within the Russian discourse of Syrian intervention, is an “empty signifier” (Laclau, 2014).
The notion of an empty signifier supposes that in a discourse – being understood as the system of meanings assigned to objects and not the language per se – for the system to be coherent, there must always be something excluded from the system itself, something outside of the system, which makes the system possible only being left aside from the system. And for the system of the discourse of Syrian intervention, Ukraine is a distortion that blocks the communication between Russia and its significant “others.” Here it is important to mention, that in 2014 only 11 countries out of 193, while voting in the UN, supported Russia in its case against Ukraine over the annexation of Crimea. The same year, according to Pew Research Center, “across the 44 countries surveyed, a median percentage of 43% have unfavorable opinions of Russia, compared with 34% who are positive. Negative ratings of Russia have increased significantly since 2013 in 20 of the 36 countries surveyed in both years, decreased in six and stayed relatively similar in the remaining 10” (Pew Research Center, 2015, 3). Other Great powers do not recognize Russia as such calling Russia a “regional power” at the very best (Guardian, 2014).
64

War in Ukraine has resulted in the gap between how Russia sees itself and how world sees it. Somehow dialogue should be restored. The way the discourse of the Russian intervention in Syria is constructed implies that Russia does not seek confrontation with the EU and the USA, but instead wants to help them solve the problems threatening them –be it a refugee crisis or the chaos caused by American policy in the Middle East. However, the language used in the Russian narrative does not necessarily imply making a deal as in trade negotiations. Instead, it is a language of a process of constantly continuing communication.
By the summer of 2015, this communication stopped and from the Russian perspective has to be restored. This can be supported by placing emphasis on Russia’s readiness for cooperation, its readiness for joint operations against ISIS, and ton Russian openness towards a fair dialogue. Therefore, the connection between wars in Ukraine and Syria within the Russian discourse is by no means causal but contextual. One can talk about the story of failed communication practices; but with the war in Ukraine Russia has found itself in a situation when its feeling of “being right” has become ignored by all relative others, and to restore this feeling and acceptance by the others, some action had to be taken.
From such a perspective, the reasoning for timing of the Syrian operation becomes relatively clear. It happened right after any other opportunities of genuine dialog between Russia and Europe, and Russia and the USA, had been blocked. However, it does not make war in Syria a simple diversion from the war in Ukraine. Instead, it is part of a longer dialogue, a hand offered to the West to admit to each other the way they are. In a certain way, Ukraine is supposed to be traded off but not for Syria. As Dmitrii Kisilev pointed out while talking about potential joint declaration on Syria made by Russia and the USA: “Russia has no hidden goal – compare it with what the USA and its allies have done in Iraq and Lybia … well, these are deeds of the past – experience” (VN, 14/02/2016, 15:51). If Russia is ready to treat former US wrongdoings against what Russia perceives as “good” – state stability – then it is also implied that Russian leadership expected the same treatment of the war in Ukraine by the West. The war in Syria in such a context is a new beginning, not a diversion – the prospect of better relationship between Russia and the West, based on mutual acceptance.
65

Summing up, there is a clear similarity between the wars in Ukraine and Syria. It is difficult to discern if the Russian elite is interested in making Russia a great power, but based on the messages it spreads, the Russian elite clearly wants Russia to at least appear as one. Therefore, the wars in both Syria and Ukraine are symbolic. The Russian elite wants an improved image and recognition from the West, and not a full-scale war. The challenges for this strategy are obviously “reality constraints,” as previously discussed. Economically, Russia is not a great power, it is not ready for a full-scale war with any other states except failed ones.
From this perspective, the conflict in Syria, which has been only deteriorating as of 2014 – autumn 2015 was a perfect stage for the Russian leadership to present itself to the world and the West in a “right” way as “a savior of civilization” (in particular Europe) against the barbarity of ISIS (caused by the “Evil” transcendental US logic of ‘international’ meaning global). Such a performance was particularly necessary after the complete misunderstanding between Russia and the West that emerged during the revolution in Kiev and following the war in Eastern Ukraine. Moreover, in contrast to Ukraine, where the West and Russia have opposite understanding of what force is “evil,” in Syria there was a potential clear common enemy. And it is hardly a coincidence that calls to unite against this enemy have become the repeating motive of the Russian narrative during the entire period of operation in Syria.
66

Conclusion
The aim of this thesis was to attempt to understand the Russian intervention into the Syrian civil war utilizing a social constructivist approach. There were several questions asked: how the narrative of Russian intervention has been constructed within Russian media, on which structural elements it was based, as well as how media analysis can be used to research armed conflicts in which modern Russia is involved. Finally, what the deconstructed narrative can add to the understanding of the worldview Russian leadership believe in. As with most qualitative research, analysis of the discovered elements of discourse and their interrelations resulted in certain assumptions that were not hypothesized prior to the study. In the following conclusion, the results of the study will be reviewed, along with the acknowledgement of its limitations, suggested directions for future research, and an assessment of the importance of the findings for proper evaluation of the directions of Russian foreign policy in the years to come.
Review of Findings
First and foremost, the results of the research suggest that the primary element of the Russian discourse of its intervention is that of an ethical origin. More than any calculated or traditional security interests, the Russian media emphasized the ethical dimension of the allegedly happening global conflict. Russian position maintains that the country acts as an independent subject, driven by a good and just moral compass. It is precisely this ethical purity that makes Russia a better great power than its opponents. These statements apparently go beyond being simple propaganda tools utilized by the Russian elite for some practical purposes. Instead, they reflect beliefs about the identity of the country as shared by the elite and general population alike. Consequently, the need to be an “independently good power” sets certain discursive limitations for Russian foreign policy.
67

Second, such an emphasis on the moral side of the conflict highlights the problem of the social function of war in Russia on an international as well as domestic level. The conducted research indicates that the performative element of war – war as a stage on which to present oneself the way one believes one is – has become the central element of war as a social phenomenon in modern Russia. War is not a continuation of politics but a continuation of identity. And in the Russian case, war as an element of identity is particular important precisely because of its particular moral dimension: being univocally good and right, and even purified, for the wrongdoings of the past. Such a particular reading of war is most likely connected with the discourse built around the Great Patriotic War, the moral experience of which is being recreated today with the help of modern media.
Third, the second function of war, derived from its self-representative element, is communicative. Since identity can develop only in its interrelation with the “other,” in modern Russia the intervention in Syria was in part a communicative action, meant to remind the West of what Russia is. Separate research is needed, though, to discover to what extent the Russian message has been received the way Russian leadership intended. What is possible to point out, however, is that with the development of warfare technologies, the symbolic elements of war, as well as the discourses built around them, are becoming no less important and may prove even more so than the actual actions on the battlefield.
Next, it appears that the timing of the Syrian intervention as a communicative action was partially determined by the emergence of the gap between how Russian leadership sees the country, on the one hand, and the West on the other following the conflict in Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has destroyed the Russian image as a “good actor,” or as a “savior of Europe,” and has caused Russia to seek its restoration by “saving” Europe once more in Syria, this time from terrorist threats and the refugee crisis.
Finally, the most unexpected finding of this research is the image of the true opponent of the Russian Federation within the narrative of Syrian intervention and any war in general. Contrary to many assumptions, it is not the USA as a country nor any other power. Instead, what the Russian leadership considers to be its enemy is the opposing logic of International, which this thesis defines as global
68

or transcendental. The Russian leadership is committed to resisting any project that claims possession of a universal moral code followed by the transnational, or even beyond-national, approach for the solution of global problems. Rather, the Russian leadership supports an intra-national approach, where different nations and moral logics meet each other and cooperate on a solution to a challenge, without even attempting to become an entity that goes beyond national interests. Compared to transcendental logic which assumes that, with the development of international relations, a true global community as an entity of a new quality greater than the sum of its parts will emerge. From the Russian narrative perspective, such a development is impossible without setting a particular way of life as the only morally right one, which for the Russian elite is unacceptable. This ethical dimension of Russian multipolarity, as the resistance to moral universalism and moral unification was an unexpected discovery.
Here it should be highlighted that such an understanding of the Russian enemy, from the perspective of the Russian elite, makes certain attitudes of Russian foreign policy more understandable. Any entity committed to transcendental logic, politicians, or projects will always be met with distrust. From this perspective, it is no coincidence that Barack Obama was the most hated American president in the Russian media. Such hatred developed precisely because his image was the embodiment of this transcendental logic of action, of what in the USA is called progressivism. Distrust towards the European Union appears to be of the same nature. Rejecting transcendental logic, and the potential of any of its adherents to be genuinely committed to the goal of the betterment of humanity, the Russian elite views all actions derived from such logic as attempts to spread chaos and evil, or as simple neo-imperialism. Ironically, such an understanding of what this thesis calls ‘transcendental logic of international’ ideologically and linguistically unites Russia with alt-right forces within the West who reject the globalism of progressivists.
As the result, it appears that the true problem in Russian-Western relations lies not in the clash of national interests, or lack of trust on its own, but the lack of a common language in which to speak. Being unable to understand or to believe in the logic of action of the one another results in a “broken phone” game when,
69

instead of messages, parties use war, sanctions, and countersanctions resulting in any attempt at discussion devolving into a game of “whataboutism.” Therefore, it is no coincidence that effective cooperation regarding Syria between Russia and the West has not emerged.
Contributions and Further direction of the research
This thesis is a case study of the discursive dimension of a particular event in modern Russian history – the Russian intervention in the Syrian civil war. However, there are still several results presented that can contribute to international relations as a science.
To begin with, this study contains the qualitative analysis of a body of data previously unanalyzed. Most studies of modern Russian media are of an instrumentalist approach, with little respect paid to their discursive structure.
Secondly, another contribution is the enhancement of the existing knowledge of the interdependency of such matters as the development of media and war technologies, the social function of war, the problem of communication in international relations, identity, and foreign policy justification, as well as the role of language and moral beliefs in foreign policy making. Consequently, there remains the need for a multidisciplinary approach while performing an analysis of foreign policy decisions.
Finally, there are some practical considerations for predicting the direction Russian foreign policy might develop in the future based on the findings of this research. Unfortunately, should the Russian elite fail to develop any way of communicating in an international arena, as well as presenting itself via an alternative to war, there is the constant risk of the country entering yet another armed conflict. This places all of the post-soviet space into jeopardy, especially countries that share a common border with Russia: Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and even Estonia, as well as any other country the Russian military is capable of attacking.
70

From the perspective of the further studies, this thesis finds that it is crucial to pursue further work on the question of the communicative element of international relations in a broad sense, in particular theorizing if the two ‘logics of international’ can co-exist with each other, or if they are doomed to conflict with one another until a victor is decided. Is there any space in which a true dialogue can take place, and what kind of mediator can the international community and all parties involved develop in order to create a language both logics can use to communicate with each other? These are the questions further studies of international relations must answer.

Abstract
This thesis explores the advocacy strategies and influence of interest groups in EU foreign policy. It examines in particular the impact of institutional factors on the strategies and lobbying outcomes. Conceptually, it contributes to the literature on interest groups and lobbying in the EU and to the study of non-state actor participation in international organisations.
Conceptualising EU foreign policy as multi-level and multi-pillar, the study inquires into the relationship between policy regime (ranging from the Community method to the intergovernmental method, as these predominate in different areas of EU external relations) and the degree and type of interest group influence. To this end the thesis compares three examples of EU foreign policy: visa liberalisation towards the Eastern neighbours; sanctions towards Belarus; and CSDP missions in Georgia and Palestine.
The research reveals that interest groups engage in multi-level lobbying even in those policy areas that are ruled by the intergovernmental method. Intergovernmentalism limits formal access to policymakers, but groups and policymakers build channels for informal access. To some extent contrary to the predications of established theories, this allows interest groups to exert some degree of influence even on policy dossiers in which intergovernmental arrangements prevail. In such policy domains, groups opposing change do not always succeed, despite the veto opportunities that intergovernmentalism provides.
While this is a significant finding, the thesis also notes how interest group influence is most commonly exerted upon relatively technical issues and at later stages of the policy cycle. Moreover, the study emphasises that institutional structures are not the only
8

relevant factor in explaining group influence. Group-level characteristics, including material resources, condition groups’ ability to adapt to complex decision-making in EU foreign policy. The thesis concludes that a combination of factors is required to capture the influence of interest groups over EU foreign policy.

Introduction
International relations and foreign policy conduct have long been seen as dominated by states. Even in the world of interdependencies and interconnections, a multiplicity of actors and heterarchy, foreign policy, border control, security and defence have been described as the last outposts of state sovereignty. Since the late 1990s the realist and neorealist visions of state dominance in international politics have been increasingly challenged. Non-state actors ranging from transnational organised crime groups and terrorist organisations to NGOs, churches and solidarity movements, as well as multinational corporations have emerged breaking the state monopoly on the exercise of power in international relations.
Similar processes have taken place in Europe, where European integration has created a web of interdependencies between economies and societies and opened the door to nonstate actors to move from the domestic political scene to the supranational level. Driving integration or trying to deal with its consequences, all kinds of organised interests have lobbied EU policymaking in the areas of the common market, international trade, agriculture, regional policy and other spheres of European integration. Multi-level governance, which emerged in Europe, is seen as especially conducive to interest group involvement in politics at the EU level as in addition to lobbying their governments they can also shift their focus to supranational venues.
The proliferation of interest groups at the European level followed the adoption of the Single European Act (1986), which expanded the powers of the European Community to new policy areas and decreased the influence of national governments in Community decision-making (Mazey & Richardson 1993). Business groups of all sorts – European
13

and national industry associations and individual firms – were first to organise themselves in Brussels. Labour and citizens groups came later, but their presence has been growing as more policymaking is done at the EU level and the European Commission has sought to boost participatory democracy in the EU by increasingly consulting with, and providing funding to, civil society actors. Citizens interest associations are the second largest group in EU politics, after EU trade and professionals associations, counting for one third of all associations constituted at the EU level (Greenwood 2007). The key question about participation of interest groups in EU politics is “who wins and who loses”. Media observers and researchers argue whether business interests are more successful in lobbying than citizens interests. The research results from larger-N studies do not provide evidence for the systematic win of corporate interest in EU legislation-making battles (Dür et al. 2015; Klüver 2013b). However, the EU interest mediation system is seen as biased towards resourceful actors, despite the fact that it provides access to different types of actors, with the labels elite pluralism (Eising 2007b) and chameleon pluralism (Coen & Katsaitis 2013), reflecting its constantly changing nature.
Unlike in many other policy domains, the EU member states have been reluctant to give up their powers and genuinely integrate foreign policies. Despite multiple treaty changes in which more and more policy areas have been communitarised – meaning that the Community/Union has acquired more powers – EU foreign policy remains largely intergovernmental and with little involvement of the supranational institutions. However, this does not mean that this area of European integration remains entirely outside of the interests of non-state actors. Whereas there are less lobby groups with interest in EU foreign, security and defence policy than in the areas of internal market,
14

trade or regional policy (see Figure 1), in which the EU produces legally binding regulation and distributes funds, this policy area is not immune to interest group involvement. The EU develops and constantly reviews its foreign policies in the areas of visas and migration, development aid, promotion of human rights, crisis management and conflict resolution. These policies are important for organised interests in the EU and they also affect non-state actors outside the Union, especially in those countries with which the EU relates and aims to assist or enable change. Participation of interest organisations in EU policymaking is crucial for the input and output legitimacy of EU foreign policy. On the one hand, the EU promotes participatory governance by trying to be more accessible and understandable to EU citizens. On the other hand, the Union seeks information about the current and potential impacts of its policies in order to improve its external performance and EU policymakers reach out to experts and interest groups for ideas and expertise. While EU participatory governance has become ‘business as usual’ in EU internal policies such as environment, energy or common market, the question is whether there are channels of access to policymakers for organised interests in EU foreign policy. It is assumed that there is not much space for interest group involvement in intergovernmental policymaking in which the Commission and the European Parliament traditionally open to societal interests have limited powers. Is this assumption correct?

The statistical data from the EU Transparency Register – a voluntary register for lobby groups in Brussels – shows that all kinds of groups seem to take an interest in EU foreign, security and defence policies and, more broadly, defined EU external relations (see Figure 2).2 Furthermore, media coverage also shows how the links between foreign and domestic policies in the EU and the member states are reflected in the mobilisation and lobbying of different types of interests on such issues as international sanctions, arms exports and military interventions. By influencing the public debate or inside lobbying, publicly or covertly, different groups mobilise to protect their interests and advance their causes; and the more external policies are made at the EU level, the more often EU institutions become targets of non-state actor advocacy. But who wins and who loses in EU foreign policy battles?

Retrieved on 27 May 2015. 2 The data of EU Transparency Register should be seen as a tentative indicator of the number of interest groups with interest in EU foreign policy issues and these figures should be treated with cautiousness for a number of reasons (see Greenwood & Dreger 2013).

Students of the EU know very little about lobbying and the influence of interest groups in policy areas dominated by intergovernmental arrangements with the leading role of the Council of the EU and the European Council. Traditionally the most lobbied and accessible EU institutions – the Commission and the Parliament – had limited or no powers in EU foreign policy. Given that there has been minimal integration in the foreign policy area, and following intergovernmentalist accounts (Moravcsik 1999), one may expect that interest groups would rather act according to ‘the two-level games’ logic, lobbying their national governments and then expecting the governments to negotiate in line with their position at the intergovernmental level. However, these expectations no longer seem to reflect the reality in Brussels. Moreover, the growing presence and involvement of non-state actors in Brussels-based foreign policymaking is in line with a theoretical shift in the analysis of EU foreign policy, which has moved from intergovernmentalism towards governance approaches that argue that powers are increasingly shared both vertically between sub-state, state, European and even global
17

levels, and horizontally between state and non-state actors. However, while governance approaches envisage interest group mobilisation at the EU level, they do not say how their mobilisation translates into influence on EU policy.
In this thesis, I aim to examine non-state advocacy in EU foreign policy which, on the one hand, is seen as one of the last bastions of nation-state sovereignty, and, on the other, is one of the most rapidly developing areas of European integration. The central research question of my study is how and to what extent interest groups influence EU foreign policy.
By studying lobbying and interest group influence on EU foreign policy, I aim to contribute to two sets of literatures. Firstly, this study will be a novelty in the literature on interests groups in the EU by focusing on a policy area that has received very little scholarly attention. Following the curve of interest group mobilisation at the EU level, researchers have focused mostly on lobbying in those policy areas where the Community/Union has powers and produces legislation. Thus, the research has centred mainly on the Commission and the European Parliament as lobbying targets, whereas these institutions are largely excluded from intergovernmental policymaking. Is the existing knowledge about lobbying and interest group influence in the EU valid for EU foreign policy? This thesis aims to make an empirical contribution through exploring what advocacy strategies groups use in EU foreign policy lobbying, on what kinds of issues they engage, whom they target among policymakers, with whom they ally, to what extent they succeed in achieving their goals and what factors it depends on.
Secondly, this thesis will be a unique and valuable contribution to EU foreign policy studies by focusing on the role of interest groups in the policymaking process. EU foreign policy scholars have mainly focused on the role of state actors – national
18

governments and parliaments – and supranational institutions, the EU bureaucracy and nascent diplomacy. Despite some recent exceptions (Joachim & Dembinski 2011; Dembinski & Joachim 2014; Voltolini 2013; Voltolini forthcoming) interest group participation and influence remains a largely unexplored agenda of the literature on EU foreign policymaking, while studying non-state actor involvement helps us to better understand how EU foreign policy is made (see K. E. Smith 2010). The empirical findings of a study on interest groups will also be helpful to those trying to theorise EU foreign policy in terms of governance approaches and the mechanisms pushing European integration in this area. Participation of interest groups and the successful of their advocacy can serve as an indicator of heterachy and the inclusion of non-state actors, which are important in governance approaches. Finally, though this work does not try to address normative issues such as to what extent interest group involvement contributes to the democratic legitimacy of the EU (for intergovernmental decisionmaking in the EU see, for example, Dembinski & Joachim 2014), it can shed light on the issue of whether the intergovernmental institutional framework which still characterises a number of EU policy areas (e.g. foreign policy, monetary and fiscal policy) works to disadvantage the participatory governance which the EU tries to promote.
On a theoretical level, by looking at the case of EU foreign policy the thesis will contribute to the literature on interest groups in the EU through examining institutional determinants on lobbying and influence. Another major question which this thesis attempts to answer is whether institutional design(s) of the EU determine(s) interest group lobbying patterns and influence over policy outcome. Does intergovernmentalism matter in the sense that it limits space for interest group involvement at the EU level? Or
19

have advocacy groups found ways to (successfully) represent their interests at the EU level despite the absence of a genuine multi-level governance framework in areas of EU foreign policy in which intergovernmentalism prevails such as the CFSP/CSDP?
Given that interest group scholars have focused on Community policy areas and the legislation making process, they have lacked the necessary variation to examine the relationship between institutional factors and interest group influence in the EU. From comparative studies of lobbying in the EU and the US (Mahoney 2008) and in the EU and the UN (Joachim & Locher 2009c), we know that the institutional context seems to impact the choice of lobbying tactics and group influence. Moreover, the literature on non-state actor participation in international organisations shows that institutional arrangements may favour or severely constrain the access of outsiders and that institutional access may vary across but also within international organisations as well as stages of the policymaking process. By conceptualising EU foreign policy as multilevel and multi-pillar (Stephan Keukeleire & MacNaughtan 2008: 29-32) that includes not only CFSP/CSDP, but also former first and third pillar issues, I will explore the relationship between institutional conditions and interest group influence and examine whether and how interest groups adapt their lobbying strategies to different decisionmaking modes in EU foreign policy. In such a conceptualisation, EU foreign policy offers a mix of institutional arrangements which differ in terms of the involvement of supranational institutions, decision-making rules in the Council, and participatory mechanisms for non-state actors’ involvement. Studies show that certainty of access affects how interest groups frame their issues or the resources they choose to rely on; in other words, the advocacy strategies they adopt (Joachim & Locher 2009a). Moreover, access is seen as an important, though not always sufficient, pre-condition of influence
20

(Tallberg et al. 2014).
Methodologically I also want to tackle the difficult question of measuring interest group influence. Although many studies on interest group politics in the EU have been conducted during the two last decades, the influence and power of interest groups in the EU remains an underexplored area (Bunea & Baumgartner 2014; Dür 2008a). This seems to be a result of how difficult it is ‘to operationalise the concepts of ‘influence’ and ‘power’, to construct reliable indicators, and to measure them empirically’ (Dür & De Bièvre, 2007: 2). Whereas interest group scholars have opted for the pragmatic approach of measuring interest group influence conceptualised as control over policy outcome, focusing on its visible manifestations and advancing significantly in measurement methods, many difficulties in measuring, collecting and validating data remain. Being conscious of these difficulties, I do not want to avoid the issue of influence given that the question of who wins and who loses remains central to our understanding of politics in the EU and further afield. In approaching the issue of influence, I will not attempt to reinvent the wheel, but instead apply tested methods in order to explore the benefits of methodological triangulation in a new case. The difficulty in measuring influence in EU foreign policy is that in the absence of a legislation-making process, with a more secretive policy environment and the confidentiality clause on many policy documents, an inquiry into influence has to rely on observations made by policy participants and stakeholders. Whereas this may impede an ‘objective’ measurement of influence (Bernhagen et al. 2014), such an exercise may also tell us more about how advocacy success and interest group influence are perceived by group representatives and policymakers. Thus, it will add to our understanding of the nature of lobbying and influence.
21

In order to study advocacy and the influence of interest groups in EU foreign policy, I will look at the issue areas most prominent in EU foreign policy such as democracy and human rights promotion and peace and state building. By doing so, I will focus on the EU policy towards neighbourhood regions and countries. The EU policy towards its neighbourhood is central to EU foreign policy: the EU’s neighbourhood has been set as one of the three key priorities of EU external relations (Ashton 2010). There is also a web of relations between the EU and neighbouring countries at the member state and sub-state levels, as well as between different actors, including non-state actors such as business companies, NGOs, political parties, citizens groups, and solidarity movements. To examine institutional determinants of lobbying and influence, I will conduct a comparative case study analysis. Focusing on three cases which represent different policy regimes (independent variable), I will examine whether and how lobbying strategies (dependent variable) and group influence (dependent variable) change as policy dossiers or issues move on the axis from the Community method to the intergovernmental method of policymaking. The cases have been selected to vary upon the key independent variable – the type of policy regime – and be most similar on other variables which may account for the variation of influence. However, some control variables (e.g. group-level characteristics) are unknown, thus, in addition to a cross-case analysis, a within-case analysis is applied to add to our understanding of the effect of the cause and explore how the institutional design affects lobbying outcome, if at all. The selected cases are visually presented in Figure 3.
22

Figure 3. Case study analysis
Given the above aims and context, the thesis is structured as follows. In Chapter 1, I discuss the main literature on which this study draws and to which it aims to contribute. I start by reviewing the role prescribed to interest groups in the main theories of European integration. I then examine how the issue of influence and its determinants has been tackled in the study of interest groups. Whereas the interest group literature in the EU offers some insights into the relationship between institutional factors and lobbying, I will also turn to the literature on non-state actors’ participation in international governance, which devotes significant attention to the issue of institutional arrangements. Finally, I discuss lobbying in the case of EU foreign policy and insights on interest group strategies, influence and its determinants provided by the limited existing studies. In Chapter 2, I present the theoretical framework and research design of this study. I introduce the main concepts used in this thesis such as interest groups, lobbying/advocacy, interest group influence, and EU foreign policy. I also present the institutional context of lobbying in the Union and introduce the concept of policy modes
23

in the EU which will be further used to study the link between institutional conditions and interest group influence in EU foreign policy. I also outline the case study research design and methodology and discuss the difficulties of measuring influence and how I will try to overcome them in this study.
In Chapters 3-5, I present the research findings of each of the case studies. In each chapter, I will describe lobbying strategies (answering the question how interest groups influence EU foreign policy) by analysing their advocacy objectives, levels and targets of lobbying, coalition building patterns, and choice of tactics. I will also discuss the results of measuring (the degree of) their influence (answering the question what influence they have) and what kind of issues and the factors upon which the influence is dependent. In Chapter 3, I show how groups lobbying on EU visa liberalisation policy towards the Eastern neighbours have been successful in keeping the issue of visa-free travel on the EU agenda, even though their influence is mostly visible on technical issues during the implementation and evaluation policy stages. In Chapter 4, CFSP sanctions policy towards Belarus emerges as a battlefield of divergent organised interests in which business groups exploit the veto powers of EU member states in the Council, whereas public interest groups struggle to overcome internal divisions and build broader advocacy coalitions for policy change involving the European Parliament and the Commission. Their influence is mostly visible in the recalibration of EU sanctions. In Chapter 5, interest groups are shielded from access to crisis management structures in Brussels. They therefore aim to increase space for their involvement through building channels of informal communication with policymakers. Groups also engage with the CSDP missions on the ground, but achieve influence on rather minor issues related to implementation of the mission mandate.
24

In the Concluding chapter, I review the overall findings of this thesis and offer empirical, theoretical and methodological reflections. In particular, I discuss how institutional factors affect interest groups’ strategies and influence. Finally, I point out future areas for research based on the central findings of the thesis.

Chapter 1. Literature review
Introduction
The main theoretical approaches to European integration view the role of interest groups in this process differently. Liberal intergovernmentalism views European integration as primarily driven by economic interests; more precisely, the commercial interests of domestic producer groups who influence their governments, with the main focus of the theory on state behaviour. National governments are seen to have ultimate power over the integration process. The role of non-state actors is limited to domestic politics. Domestic groups are engaged in the process of national preference formation, while a national government may use supranational institutions to reduce opposition from unsupportive domestic groups (Moravcsik 1999: 73, 473; Moravcsik & Schimmelfennig 2009). This approach is guided by the logic of two-level games, in which only national politicians participate at both domestic and international levels, whereas domestic groups pursue their interests by pressuring their governments (Putnam 1988).
In contrast, neofunctionalism puts an emphasis on the role of non-state actors – interest associations and social movements formed at the European level. According to this theory, once member states initially decide to cooperate within the regional organisation, supranational institutions and interest groups become the main drivers of European integration. Neofunctionalists hypothesised that integration would lead to the formation of regional interest groups that would be active at the regional and/or national levels (Haas 1968: 354, 388; Schmitter 1970: 856) and that an increase of regional interest groups would be instrumental in overcoming national resistance to expand the scale and the level of integration (Schmitter 1970: 858). Regional groups would
26

enhance the reform-promoting role of supranational institutions in the process of integration. A change would also occur on the domestic level: national actors would appear differentiated in classes, status groups, subregions, etc., and these sub-national actors would form transnational coalitions of opposition and support (Schmitter 1970: 864).
Whereas liberal intergovernmentalism is criticised for its failure to recognize the role of interest groups both at the domestic and European level in EU integration and day-today policymaking (Cowles 2003), neofunctionalism is accused of going too far in its estimations of interest group power in the integration process and assumptions of excessive homogeneity in the pressures that would be brought by interest groups upon national governments (Niemann & Schmitter 2009). Nonetheless, neofunctionalism has inspired such conceptual approaches as multi-level governance (see George 2004).
Governance approaches to European integration share a common understanding that power does not form the monopoly of state and is shared between different actors and levels. As Pierre (2000: 3-4) notes, “[In] much of the public and political debate, governance refers to sustaining co-ordination and coherence among variety of actors with different purposes and objectives such as political actors and institutions, corporate interests, civil society, and transnational organisations. What previously were indisputable roles of government are now increasingly seen as more common, generic, societal problems which can be resolved by political institutions but also by other actors. The main point here that political institutions no longer exercise a monopoly of the orchestration of governance” (Pierre 2000: 3-4).
The concept of EU governance focuses on distinct features of EU polity and policymaking. Some scholars underline its regulatory character, while others focus on
27

its multi-level nature, and on segmentation and differentiation. There is also debate as to the level of democratic deficit in the EU (for an overview, see Kohler-Koch & Rittberger 2006; B. G. Peters & Pierre 2009). A common thread in these concepts is an emphasis on the role of non-state actors in the EU.
According to the multi-level governance (MLG) perspective, decision-making competences are no longer monopolised by state authorities, but are instead shared by various actors at different levels – subnational, national and supranational. The MLG approach implies that political arenas at different levels are interconnected rather than nested as state-centric approaches argue. This means that subnational actors, including interest groups, operate at both a domestic and European level, creating transnational coalitions (Marks et al. 1996; Hooghe & Marks 2001; Jachtenfuchs & Kohler-Koch 2004). Multi-level governance scholars describe EU decision-making as less technocratic and more “politicized-participatory” where the stakes of political conflict are higher, the scope of authoritative decision-making broader, and there are more avenues for interest group influence and political mobilization (Hooghe & Marks 2001: 126).
Whereas MLG has been criticised on many accounts, including for lacking a causal motor of integration and set of testable hypotheses (Jordan 2001), with regard to nonstate actors, this theoretical approach is thin in explaining how and why substate actors mobilise (Warleigh 2006) and the difference between mobilisation of substate actors and their power to shape policy outcomes (Jordan 2001). To address the participation vs. power issue, some scholars distinguish between multi-level governance and multi-level participation, where the latter notion would mean greater involvement without effective influence for at least some types of new actors (Bache & Flinders 2004). Others
28

suggest the use of the MLG approach in combination with policy networks analysis in order to explore the extent to which participation equals influence and multi-level governance is present in a policy area (Warleigh 2006: 93-94). Rhodes defines policy networks as “sets of formal institutional and informal linkages between governmental and other actors structured around shared if endlessly negotiated beliefs and interests in public policymaking and implementation. These actors are interdependent and policy emerges from the interactions between them” (Rhodes 2008: 426). Analysing EU governance through policy networks analysis can explain EU policy outcomes in a particular sector through the influence of different actors, including non-state actors (Peterson 2009).
Whereas the key theoretical approaches explaining European integration have something to say about the role of non-state actors in this process, there is no unity among them as to when and at what level interest groups mobilise to lobby and what influence they have on EU policymaking. Instead, a growing literature on lobbying and interest groups in the EU has taken a closer look at interest group mobilisation and the maintenance, density and diversity of the interest group population as well as issues of lobbying strategies and influence on policy outcomes.
This literature has come out of the MLG assumption viewing European integration among the “main causes for the changing nature, and growing importance of interest group politics in Europe” (Beyers et al. 2008: 1111). Thus, the bulk of studies on interest groups in the EU focus on those policy areas in which European integration has advanced most, and the supranational institutions have significant competencies, for example, EU trade policy, internal market, common agricultural policy or environmental policy. In contrast, few studies examine interest group involvement in
29

those areas in which intergovernmenalism is a dominant method for policymaking such as EU foreign policy. Equally, the literature on EU foreign policymaking also largely omits the issue of participation and the influence of non-state actors (K. E. Smith 2010). Nevertheless, there is a growing number of interest groups in the EU foreign policy arena, as the EU Transparency Register and their public activity in Brussels reveal. This thesis aims to explore non-state actor advocacy in EU foreign policymaking and, in particular, examine the relationship between institutional factors on the one hand, and interest group strategies and influence on the other. Therefore, in the following sections, I provide an overview of the main literature to which it aims to contribute and on which it draws. First, I turn to the literature on interest groups in the EU focusing on the issues of influence and factors determining it. Given that the literature on lobbying in the EU has largely avoided areas of intergovernmental politics, I then explore the literature on participation of non-state actors in international intergovernmental organisations which provide some insight on why intergovernmental organisations open or restrict access to non-state actors. Finally, I present the literature theorising EU foreign policy, in particular those studies that signal that EU foreign policy may be conducive to the involvement of non-state actors. I also review what the few existing studies on non-state actors’ involvement in EU foreign policymaking reveal about advocacy strategies and influence. I conclude by outlining my main contribution to the literatures reviewed.
1. Lobbying and influence of interest groups in the EU
Whereas the EU interest group literature accounts for slightly over two decades, many theoretical assumptions, research questions and hypotheses have been borrowed from a
30

century-old corpus of US literature on interest groups directly or via European national studies on interest groups (for example, from UK literature on British interest groups). The US literature has focused on interest mobilisation, organisational maintenance, lobbying strategies and, of particular significance to this study, the influence of interest groups (for an overview of the US interest groups literature see Hojnacki et al. 2012; Lowery & Gray 2004; Baumgartner & Leech 1998). One of the key debates that has been also brought to the EU interest groups literature concerns the power of money in politics and whether resource-rich interests tend to define outcomes of public policy. Whereas an overview of the literature on EU interest groups has been done elsewhere (see Bunea & Baumgartner 2014; Beyers et al. 2008; Eising 2008b; Coen 2007), in this section I focus on the bulk of studies which examine the issue of influence.
The influence and power of interest groups in the EU still remains a comparatively under-researched area (Bunea & Baumgartner 2014; Dür 2008a; Dür 2008b; Dür & De Bièvre 2007b). Reviewing the EU interest groups literature, Bunea and Baumgartner (2014:1422) calculate that merely 11% of studies focus on influence. The reason given for this is the difficulty “to operationalise the concepts of ‘influence’ and ‘power’, to construct reliable indicators, and to measure them empirically” (Dür & De Bièvre 2007b: 2).
Most studies of interest groups in the EU have been conducted in the case study mode testing hypotheses stemming from the literature on interest groups in the US, Great Britain and other Western countries. These studies have generated many insights on lobbying and influence in the EU, however, they have also reached contradictory conclusions as to what types of groups are influential in the EU and what factors determine their influence (Dür 2008a; Eising 2008). Quantitative studies of lobbying
31

and influence have started to appear recently. In her book, Klüver studied key conditions of lobbying success by looking at 56 policy issues and over 2500 interest groups participating in the European Commission’s online consultations (Klüver 2013c). Other examples of ongoing large-N research projects are ‘Intereuro’3 conducted by nine European universities that examines interest groups lobbying strategies, their impact on policy outcomes and their networks by focusing on 100 legislative proposals in the EU; and ‘Interarena’ that analyses group influence towards the bureaucracy, parliament and the media in three EU countries (Denmark,4 UK and Germany) (see also the special issue of Journal of European Public Policy “Legislative lobbying in context: the policy and polity determinants of interest group politics in the European Union” 2015, 22:4).
However, the scholarship of interest group influence centres on policy areas or issues that belong to the former first pillar, in which the Community method applies. In respect to a policy area, case studies focus on EU trade policy (Cowles 1995; Dür 2008a; Dür & De Bièvre 2007a; De Bièvre & Eckhardt 2011), environmental policy (Bugdahn 2008; Zito & Jacobs 2009; Bunea 2013), common agricultural policy (Grant 1978; Egdell & Thompson 1999), competition policy (García & Meier 2012), and services (e.g. information technologies, telecommunications, transport) (Michalowitz 2007; Woll 2007). Studies on interest groups influencing intergovernmental decision making in the EU are rare (Voltolini 2013; Dembinski 2009; Joachim & Dembinski 2011 on the CFSP; Friedrich 2008 and Uçarer 2009 on the former third pillar).
The focus of the literature is predominantly on the legislation making process (see Klüver et al. 2015), which is not only the most productive and socially important area
3 See the project website http://www.intereuro.eu/. 4 For Interarena in Denmark see the project website http://interarena.dk.
32

of EU policymaking, but also has clear decision-making procedures and timeframes and, in most cases, results in tangible policy outcomes – legislative acts. Moreover, the studies tend to focus on the agenda setting and policy formulation stage and groups influencing the Commission (Bunea & Baumgartner 2014), with some of them looking specifically at interest group participation in the consultations run by the Commission (Klüver 2013; Bunea 2013). Such a focus is justified as agenda-setting is the first phase of the policy cycle and groups try to influence policy as early as possible. Moreover, the availability of initial consultation documents and final legislative proposals as well as published positions of interest groups enable the collection of data necessary for a more ‘objective’ measurement of influence. However, stronger research designs that look at specific modes of influence and produce robust findings limit the scope of our inference about influence (Lowery 2013: 19). While studies looking at influence on decisionmaking in the European Parliament (EP) have become more frequent (Wessels 1999; Bouwen 2004b; Marshall 2010; Marshall 2012; Marshall 2015; Rasmussen 2015), this is not the case for the Council of the EU and other EU institutions and bodies. Research looking at participation of lobbying groups in decision-making, implementation and evaluation of EU policies is equally scarce (Bunea & Baumgartner 2014).
The research debate in the EU (and the US) focuses on exploring the relationship between influence and various factors that determine it, or, in other words, the focus of the research is on the lobbying context. Following the appeal of Baumgartner and Leech (1998: 134), instead of only focusing on the question of “whether interest groups are ever influential” or not, researchers also try to find out “when, why, and to what extent they are powerful on what types of issues”.
The lobbying context is a wide term to describe different kinds of factors that affect the
33

choice of lobbying strategies and influence. Three types of context that attract major attention of researchers studying what determines lobbying success or failure are group characteristics, policy issue characteristics and institutional environment in which the groups lobby (Hojnacki et al. 2012; Dür & De Bièvre 2007b). In addition to the three main types of influence determinants, Dür includes the fourth cluster – interest group strategies – which is the most unexplored in the study of interest groups’ influence (Dür 2008b: 1213). Empirical studies on interest group influence determinants have produced some insightful and valuable but also often contradictory results, partly due to the fact that they examine influence across different policy areas and focus on different sets of variables operationalising them differently (Dür & De Bièvre 2007b; Dür 2008a).
One of the most frequently posed research questions concerns the impact of resources in interest groups lobbying and influence in the EU. Following the US interest groups literature, students of the EU repeatedly ask the question of who wins and who loses in EU politics. Control over resources which Dahl defined as “anything that can be used to sway the specific choices or the strategies of another individual” (Dahl 1961: 225) has been one of the most common conceptualisations of power, which can be indirectly represented by resources (Simon 1953; Hart 1976). Consequently, more resourceful groups are seen more influential.
Taking into account the technocratic character of EU decision-making, information is seen as the most important resource which interest groups exchange for access and influence, whereas lobbying in the EU is often conceptualised as information exchange drawing on resource dependence theories (Bouwen 2002; Bouwen 2004a; Chalmers 2011; Klüver 2013b). According to Bouwen’s theory of access which has become extremely widespread in EU lobbying studies, private actors require access to the EU
34

institutions, while the EU institutions demand certain ‘access goods’ in return (Bouwen 2002). Most common ‘access goods’ are different types of information which a group can provide. Each EU institution favours a certain type of ‘access good’ that certain types of interest groups are more likely to provide, therefore, different institutions provide access to different interest groups depending on their specific resource needs (Bouwen 2002; Bouwen 2004). However, other types of resources such as financial and membership resources, group size, reputation also matter.
The central discussion in the literature has been whether the EU system is biased towards resource-rich business interests to the detriment of citizens interests. Larger-N studies reveal that business groups are “overall, less successful than citizen groups” in the legislative decision-making process in the EU or at least no single type of interest dominates policy outcomes in the EU (Dür et al. 2015). Different types of interests – citizens groups, foundations, trade and business associations – are likely to achieve influence in the EU (Mahoney 2008; Chalmers 2011; Klüver 2013a).
However, the EU interest mediation system still seems to be based toward resource-rich groups. A larger-N research reveals that business groups, especially resource-rich associations, active in policy areas with high competence of the EU are more involved in EU-level lobbying (‘Europeanised’) than other types of groups (Dür & Mateo 2014b). This conforms with previous findings showing that there is the business group bias in representation in Commission’s consultations (Klüver 2013a), that well-endowed corporate actors, large firms are more likely to become multi-level players than national business associations (Cowles 2001; Eising 2004), that well-resourced and professionalised NGOs are more likely to directly lobby in Brussels than smaller groups (Fairbass & Jordan 2002; Joachim & Locher 2009a), and that social movements are
35

much less Europeanised that organised interests (Imig & Tarrow 2001).
Issue characteristics have also received significant attention in the literature on interest groups in the EU (as well as in the US). Scholars argue that issue characteristics, such as policy type, degree of technicality, degree of conflict, salience of the issue affect interest group influence and choice of strategies (Dür 2008a; Dür & De Bièvre 2007b; Beyers 2008; Mahoney 2008). Studying lobbying across a larger number of policy issues in the EU and the US, Mahoney argues that the larger an issue is in scope and salience and the higher the level of conflict, the less likely lobbyists are to achieve their aims (Mahoney 2007; Mahoney 2008). Klüver contests this finding arguing that the effect of salience is not constant and that there is a relation between salience and the size of lobbying coalition: if interest groups belong to the relatively larger coalition, salience has a positive effect on lobbying success, whereas if interest groups belong to the relatively smaller coalition, then salience has a negative effect (Klüver 2011). A recent research shows that groups representing diffuse interests are more likely than business interests to share views with Commission officials of what is at stake in EU legislation when many interest groups are involved in lobbying and when the degree of media publicity is low (Boräng & Naurin 2015). The conflict expansion filters out narrow self-regarding frames benefiting civil society groups, whereas media dominated by resourceful business actors has the opposite effect (ibidem).
The studies examining how institutional environment conditions lobbying and interest group influence in the EU are less common. This may be explained by the lack of variation across institutional set-ups given the scholarly attention to the legislationmaking under the Community method. At the same time, it is argued that institutions may empower certain types of groups directly (e.g. by providing funding or a
36

privileged access) or indirectly (by having demand in a certain type of resources that groups possess – money for re-election, information or expertise necessary in policymaking process) (Dür & De Bièvre 2007b; Dür 2008a).
Borrowed from the literature on social movements and political protests, the concept of ‘political opportunity structure’ is frequently used in the interest group literature. Broadly defined, political opportunity structure is “the set of characteristics of a given institution that determines the relative ability of (outside) groups influence decision making within that institution” (Princen & Kerremans 2008: 1130). Thus, political opportunity structure includes formal elements, such as voting or participation rules, and informal elements, such as norms, common practices and institutional culture (Joachim & Locher 2009b:9). In a narrower sense, political opportunity structure refers to access for political actors and the receptivity of the political system (Princen & Kerremans 2008: 1131). “Opportunity structures” are mainly studied from a perspective that views them as a fixed external constraint on interest groups behaviour. The other perspective considers “opportunity structures” as the defined and formed as part of the political process in which political actors identify and construct opportunity structures (for overview see Princen & Kerremans 2008).
Research that highlights the role of institutional determinants of lobbying and influence is conducted through comparative studies of the EU with other political systems such as the United States (Mahoney 2008; Woll 2012) and the United Nations (Joachim & Locher 2009c). Comparing lobbying in the EU and the US, Mahoney (2008: 193) concludes that “institutional design emerges as a factor in understanding lobbying success”. First, she reveals that the EU system, though less electorally accountable, appears to be more responsive to interest groups’ views: a larger share of groups achieve
37

some level of influence than in the US. Second, given that in the EU a policy change is more likely once the Commission makes a proposal for legislation than in the US, more lobbyists are more likely to achieve some degree of success in the EU than in the US, where the system producers clear winners and losers. This may explain, as Mahoney argues, the fact that the EU system is less biased to any type of interests than the US system is in which business interests are clearly more likely to win than to lose. Finally, given that there is no pan-European media system, advocates in the EU deploy outside lobbying tactics to a lesser degree than advocates in the US do (Mahoney 2008).
Lastly, the influence of interest groups depends on strategies they employ to use their resources, existing political opportunity structures and issue characteristics effectively (Dür 2008b: 1218). Yet, little research exists on the relationship between interest groups strategies and influence.
What is evident from the literature is that the choice of strategies also seems to depend upon the political institutions which groups target. Beyers demonstrates that in the EU actors with access to the European Parliament combine it with voice strategies more often that actors seeking access to the Commission, whereas, while lobbying the Commission, groups with access to the political cabinets of the Commissioners tend to use voice more often than those with access to the Commission General Directorates, purely technocratic units (Beyers 2004: 234-235). However, in addition to institutional factors, group characteristics and issue characteristics also affect how interest groups lobby (Mahoney 2008). For instance, civil society groups are more inclined to use outside lobbying than business groups (Kollman 1998: 41; Mahoney 2008: 163).
Chalmers argues that “the medium is more important that the message” showing that lobbying tactics are even more important that the content of information provided by the
38

groups in exchange for access to EU policymakers (Chalmers 2013). Moreover, his study shows that despite the fact that inside tactics are more spread in the EU, as they are seen by lobbyists as “less costly” and “more expedient”, outside tactics are “not inherently less effective” and applied by groups “disadvantaged at the policy process” as the previous studies argued (see Beyers 2004: 216). As Chalmers (2013: 54) explains, “standing out from the crowd” by adopting tactics which are “not thoroughly institutionalized” such as media campaigns and public events creates “very important paths of access to the EU”.
There are few more recent studies focusing on framing as an important element of lobbying strategies (see Klüver, Mahoney, et al. 2015; Eising et al. 2015). Framing involves selecting and emphasizing some aspects of an issue while deliberately ignoring others in order to shape policy debates in favour of a group’s interest. While frames tend to be dependent upon a group type (public interest groups tend to rely on public frames such as environment, human rights and consumer protection, while sectional groups are more likely to use economic frames), institutional context such as which European Commission DG a group lobbies also seems to play a role in the choice of frames (Klüver, Mahoney, et al. 2015).
Finally, the literature points out that choice of lobbying strategy and tactics may relate not only to intended influence on policy outcome, but also be based on other needs of interest groups, such as their organisational survival (see Lowery & Gray 2004: 170). Use of particular lobbying tactics can influence the life chances of lobby organisations, thereby influencing the structure and size of interest communities (Lowery 2007:42). As Lowery notes, lobbying on one issue that is less than central to an organisation may be vital to secure support from political elites or coalition allies on issues the organisation
39

cares about, or alternatively an organization with a poor reputation may choose in favour of outside lobbying to create a more favourable public opinion environment. Berkhout (2013) argues for studying exchange relationships of interest groups not only with public officials, but also with interest group supporters and media in order to add the ‘logic of support’ and the ‘logic of reputation’ to the ‘logic of influence’ to our explanations of interest group behaviour. To conclude, there is a growing body of literature focusing on lobbying and influence in the EU. Researchers are keen to learn not only whether interest groups are influential in the EU, but also what types of groups systematically win or lose in the EU policymaking and under what contextual conditions. The literature has developed a mix of variables that may account for the choice of lobbying strategies and lobbying success and some of them have been examined empirically, including in the larger-N studies. Whereas the research has focused on group-level and issue-level characteristics, studies on the institutional determinants of influence have been less frequent. This is partly due to the fact that the literature looks at legislative policymaking and, in particular, agenda setting and policy formulation stage led by the Commission. However, there are EU policy domains which lie outside legislation making and in which participation of supranational institutions is limited and intergovernmental politics prevails. Given that the foreign policy of the EU is one such policy area, institutional characteristics may be the most distinctive conditions which impact upon lobbying patterns and influence in comparison with other policy areas.

2. Institutional determinants of participation of non-state actors in international organisations
Before turning to the overview of the few studies that examine lobbying in EU foreign policy, I will briefly overview the insights from the studies of participation and influence of non-state actors (NSA) in international intergovernmental organisations which have a particular focus on the role of institutions. This literature examines participation of the NSA in global governance. In particular, it focuses on the issue of broadly defined access which international intergovernmental organisations provide for the NSA, examining formal rules and informal practices (Steffek et al. 2008; Joachim & Locher 2009c; Jönsson & Tallberg 2010; Irrera 2013; Tallberg et al. 2014). The research focus is more on the demand side of lobbying: it explores how opportunity structures of international organisations benefit or restrain participation of NSA in their policies.
This literature has addressed the issue from different theoretical perspectives (for an overview see Tallberg 2010). Some scholars argue on sociological institutionalist and constructivist grounds that access is increasingly provided to the NSA due to the spread of participatory governance norms (Saurugger 2010). Drawing on rationalist assumptions, other scholars maintain that functional logic and resource exchange models better explain why access is provided to the NSA (Mayer 2008; Steffek 2010; Tallberg et al. 2014). What is important for this study is that having a variety of institutional arrangements, the literature has examined what factors accounts for differences in NSA access across
41

and within international organisations (Steffek et al. 2008;Tallberg et al. 2014). In the study of the institutional mechanisms through which non-state actors may take part in the policy process across 298 organisational bodies from fifty international organisations between 1950 and 2010, Tallberg and his collaborators argue that three causal factors – demand for resources and services of transnational non-state actors, domestic democratic standards in the member states of international organisations and state concerns with national sovereignty explain the variation of access within and across international organisations (Tallberg et al. 2014). The functional advantages of NSA participation account for the expansion of access over time and for variation across and within international organisations with democratic membership being another source of additional openness toward NSA. Sovereignty costs of associated with NSA involvement have been a principal constraint on access and contributed to variation across issue areas and policy functions (ibidem). They find only limited empirical support for the constructivist argument about the spread of participatory norms of global governance, according to which policy-makers have been either socialised into believing in the appropriateness of NSA participation or have strategically adapted the institutional arrangements to boost organisational legitimacy.
Moreover, there are also variations of levels of access across policy fields (Steffek et al. 2008; Steffek 2010; Tallberg et al. 2014). Human rights, development and environmental policies are more open to NSA, whereas security is more closed (Tallberg et al. 2014). The research points out that issue areas and policy functions which are associated with high sovereignty costs are likely to be closed to the NSA participation. Furthermore, it is argued that there is also a significant variation across stages of the policymaking process: implementation, evaluation and policy formulation
42

stages are more open to NSA, whereas the decision-making stage is more closed (ibidem).
Even within the security realm, variation in terms of access and transparency exists between different international organisations. A comparative study shows that NATO is closed to non-governmental organisations (NGOs), whereas the OSCE has been open and supportive of civil society since its foundation (Mayer 2008). As Mayer argues, rationalist and functional logics helps to explain the difference. If one adopts the lens of resource exchange, one can see that differences in the tasks and capabilities of the two international organisations translate into “an unequal demand for resources” provided by the NSA such as knowledge, legitimacy and personnel (ibidem: 119). Mayer argues that the OSCE’s focus on the civilian side of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding, extension of security provision towards human rights and democratisation and more limited resources account for more favourable conditions for NSA participation compared to those granted by NATO.
This literature also examines the relationship between opportunity structures of international organisations and NSA strategies. Comparing formal and informal elements of access provided to NGOs at the UN and the EU, researchers conclude that despite institutional differences between these organisations and variation of access across organisational bodies, issues at stake and the policy cycle, the EU and the UN are also “worlds together” in how they shape NGO strategies understood as mobilising resources and frames (Joachim & Locher 2009c). Both organisations favour certain type of NGOs – more professionalised and resourceful actors – which rely on “institutional as opposed to voice and protest strategies preferring conventional lobbying over contentious action” (Joachim & Locher 2009a: 176). At both organisations, NGOs also
43

frame issues in an easy-to-comprehend manner which appeals to diverse constituencies. The more NGOs are unsure about access, the more they rely on more consensual issue framing (ibidem). Furthermore, Joachim and Locher argue that international organisations not only impact the choice of strategies employed by NGOs, but they shape their constitution – “their organizational features by encouraging the formation of networks and platforms” and “professionalization and bureaucratization of NGOs by asking for and privileging scientific expertise and information over other forms of knowledge on specific issues” (ibidem: 178). In sum, the literature on non-state actors’ participation in global governance suggests that different institutional arrangements translate into different participation patterns of NSA, and that rationalist accounts, and in particular resource exchange models, are potent tools to explain the variation. The literature, however, has not examined the question of influence conceptualised as a control over policy outcome. Whereas Tallberg and his collaborators (2014) argue that access may serve as an institutional precondition for NSA influence, they do not assume a linear relationship between access and influence and leave the issue of influence for future research.
3. The case of EU foreign policymaking
Whereas the participation and influence of non-state actors in world politics and international governance has been increasingly recognized and researched (Keck & Sikkink 1998; della Porta et al. 1999; Josselin & Wallace 2001; Jönsson & Tallberg 2010; Vasconcelos 2011; Scholte 2011), focus on interest groups is less prevalent in the literature on EU foreign policy. Early studies naturally focused on such actors as the
44

Member States and the Commission (Hill 1996). With a flourishing debate on democratic legitimacy in the EU, scholars have started to look at the role of representative bodies such as the European Parliament and national parliaments in EU foreign policy (Barbé & Herranz 2005; Barbé & Herranz 2007; Diedrichs 2004; Zanon 2010; Caballero-Bourdot 2011; Peters et al. 2010; Huff 2015). More recent inquiries have been made into the roles of EU bureaucratic and diplomatic actors (Dijkstra 2008; Dijkstra 2009; Duke 2012; Grevi 2007; Vanhoonacker et al. 2010; Carta 2012; Vanhoonacker & Pomorska 2013) and public opinion (Dumoulin & Manigart 2010). Few have recognised a role of interest groups as constituencies of EU foreign policy (Hill 2003) and the existence of a variety of non-state actors in agenda setting and participation in policy implementation of EU foreign policy (Keukeleire 2003; Keukeleire & MacNaughtan 2008). Meanwhile, reviews of the state of art in EU foreign policy studies have pointed to the need to pay attention to the roles of interest groups with regards to research into the formation of EU foreign policy (Smith 2010) and the democratic legitimacy of EU foreign policy (Smith 2008). Moreover, the departure from intergovernmentalism and application of governance approaches in theorising the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) implies that EU foreign policy should not be devoid of non-state actor involvement.
Norheim-Martinsen argues that such phenomena as “the impact of ‘Brusselization’ on CSDP, the role of individual entrepreneurship in the ‘Solana era’, the socializing effects of institutions and the presence of a European security identity or culture […] all fit intriguingly well with the five features of security governance (Norheim-Martinsen 2010: 1352). Identified earlier by a team of scholars (Webber et al. 2004), these features
45

are: (1) heterarchy, or the existence of multiple centres of power; (2) the interaction of multiple actors, both public and private; (3) formal and informal institutionalization; (4) relations between actors that are ideational in character; and (5) a collective purpose. Mérand and his collaborators (2011) go further in applying the governance approach in conjunction with social network analysis as a method to analyse the CSDP. They find that CSDP governance is more heterarchical and two-level than intergovernmentalists acknowledge, yet state power is not diluted but reconstituted at the European level (Mérand et al. 2011: 140).
Michael Smith argues that MLG is applicable to the realm of the CFSP, even though supranational institutions have been marginalized in this policy area. In his view, this approach can explain “how common general interests are defined, prioritized, and translated into concrete policy actions through institutionalized behaviours at the EU and domestic levels” (M. Smith 2004b: 743, italics in original). According to Smith, the applicability of the MLG approach varies depending on an issue within the CFSP. Factors that define the degree of MLG approach to the CFSP are inherent characteristics of the policy problem/issue; stages of the policymaking sequence; novelty of the policy decision; and domestic factors. Smith hypothesizes that “the multi-level governance of the CFSP will be most optimal in situations where: the issue conforms to a European Council mandate; the decision is reached by QMV (or no insistence on a consensus), has a long time horizon, and does not involve violence; the policy involves explicit delegation to EU organizations or a pre-existing framework; funding is provided by the EU budget; and the European Parliament provides input as required by the policy decision. In addition, governance will be improved in cases of follow-on policies (or where there is enough time for deliberation on more complex problems, especially
46

where a mandate and/or consensus are lacking) and where the issue is covered by an existing CFSP group” (M. Smith 2004b: 753). Conversely, he argues that multi-level governance is most difficult where there is no European Council mandate for a given issue, whether in geographical or functional terms; little consensus/use of veto in case of QMV; a probability of violence and a short term horizon; national implementation and funding; and a lack of mechanisms for democratic oversight (ibidem).
Indeed, few studies focusing on non-state actors in EU foreign policy show that nonstate actors mobilise to lobby on EU foreign policy, including on the CFSP issues. A study on NGO involvement in the development of the European Code of Conduct/Common Position on Arms Export shows that NGOs engage and exert influence at the EU level on EU foreign and security policy under the CFSP, whereas the Europeanization of arms export regulations increased the voice opportunities of NGOs (Joachim & Dembinski 2011). Joachim and Dembinski find that NGOs contributed to the adoption of a legally binding framework for arms export control at the EU level in 2008 which substituted the legally non-binding Code of Conduct of 1998: “[a]lthough weapons sales have not yet declined significantly, NGOs have used the Code to change the rules of the game through which they are approved” (Joachim & Dembinski 2011: 1152). These findings are in line with an earlier assumption put forward by the literature that expanding scope of areas of EU governance stimulates the mobilisation of more diverse sets of interests (Beyers et al. 2008: 1116).
This case study reveals that institutional conditions did play a role in the lobbying success, along with particular characteristics of interest groups’ movement (the degree of their multi-level cooperation and professionalisation). In an earlier work, Dembinski argues that the CFSP decision-making system is less favourable to NGOs than the first
47

pillar, mainly due to the lack of an equivalent of the Commission’s supportive role in the second pillar (Dembinski 2009). Whereas the powers of the Commission and the Parliament are weaker, the Commission is also less inclined to accept NGOs as partners in CFSP. It does not consider NGOs as proper stakeholders, but as “the self-declared advocates of the common good” (Dembinski 2009: 165). The consultation culture with NGOs was less developed and institutionalized in DG External Relations than in other DGs. Contrary to a shared belief, the Council and its members interact with NGOs. However, it does not substitute the support of the Commission in the first pillar (ibidem).
The institutional constraints did not prevent NGOs from engaging in EU action on the issue of arms export control from the early 1990s. However, until the Code of Conduct, a first political document regulating arms exports at the EU level, was adopted in 1998, their impact was limited (Joachim & Dembinski 2011: 1156). Tracing the process of NGOs’ activities on the issue across almost two decades, Joachim and Dembinski argued that Europeanisation, access points and norms facilitated NGO involvement and contributed to their success.
First, the EU-level governance of arms export control established by the 1998 Code of Conduct reinforced the Europeanisation of NGOs coalition (Joachim & Dembinski 2011: 1163). Whereas initially it had been dominated by British NGOs, groups from other member states became involved over time. The UK-based organisations launched a Europe-wide campaign and managed to attract over 600 NGOs across Europe to support a Code of Conduct on arms exports (ibidem: 1158). Although many of these groups were rooted at the domestic level, they coordinated their efforts at the European level and informed their national audiences about developments in the EU. As Joachim
48

and Dembinski state, “[t]hese cross-level interdependencies added to the strength and leverage of NGOs vis-a-vis governments”(ibidem).
Second, access points have multiplied as the role of the Commission has turned from an observer into an active participant of the CFSP, with NGOs allied with the EP using its democratic oversight power. Formal and informal rules encouraging cooperation with NGOs have appeared at the Council’s level. The changes in the positions of key governments – the UK (due to the victory of the Labour party in the elections) and France (due to scandals connected to arms trade with repressive regimes and strategic calculations to keep US influence at bay on the arms export policies of its allies) – were critical (ibidem: 1159).
Third, NGOs benefited from the gradual expansion of norms established by the EU in the defence policy area, allowing them to scrutinise further the behaviour of member states with regards to weapons sales. NGOs used normative arguments and called for a greater degree of responsibility to be placed upon arms exporters while also providing advice to policymakers on how to improve current European regulation.
The strategies adopted by NGOs did not differ significantly from those of the first pillar. NGOs mainly relied on insider strategies providing information and expertise. They successfully engaged at both domestic and European levels at all stages of the policy process. Besides supranational actors such as the EP and the Commission, NGOs also lobbied the Council, its Secretariat and EU presidencies. As the case of Spanish NGOs demonstrates, the organisations put pressure on a national representative in the COARM (Council’s Working Party of Conventional Arms Exports) to become a spokesperson for increased transparency rules at the EU level and used the 1998 Code of Conduct together with what they perceived as best practice in other EU states as a lobbying tool
49

to exact from the national government far-reaching transparency and reporting rules (Joachim & Dembinski 2011: 1163).
Despite these insights into NGO participation in CFSP policymaking, the case study lacks an analysis of the involvement of a second possible group of actors, namely arms industry representatives. It remains unknown the degree of influence NGOs had in comparison to this second group. We do not know whether the counter-lobbying efforts of the European defence industry, or lack thereof, affected NGOs’ success during the two stages of the policy process (prior to and post the adoption of the 1998 Code of Conduct). With just a single case study it is impossible to establish to what extent interest group influence is determined by institutional factors as opposed to, for instance, issue characteristics (e.g. novelty of issue). A comparative case study analysis could shed more light on the relationship between political institutions and influence.
A recent book-length study of lobbying in EU foreign policy focusing on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict stands apart from the interest group literature as it approaches the issue of lobbying from a different theoretical perspective exploring how constructivist insights help to understand lobbying in the EU (Voltolini 2013; Voltolini forthcoming).
While interest group scholars have argued for a more pragmatic approach toward measuring influence and thus, assuming that interest groups have clear and stable preferences which do not change in interaction with other actors and focusing on more “visible” faces of power (Dür 2008b; Dür 2008a) and viewing lobbying as exchange relationship based on resource dependencies between groups and policymakers (Bouwen 2002; Chalmers 2011; Klüver 2013b), Voltolini takes a “thin” constructivist line arguing that influence is not unidirectional and that identities and preferences of both non-state actors and EU institutions are shaped in the process of interaction
50

between them, putting emphasis on knowledge and its social construction rather than on information. In this view, groups are not expected to adapt their lobbying tactics and strategies to the venues they lobby, but their behaviour is seen as an effect of socialisation with other actors. Thus, at the theoretical level, assuming in line with the constructivist view that lobbying is embedded in social interactions between the nonstate actors and policymakers, Voltolini examines what roles non-state advocates play in EU foreign policy, what frames they use and at what levels.
First of all, Voltolini refutes “the ‘null hypothesis’ of no or limited lobbying activities in EU foreign policy” and EU foreign policy as a domain “predominantly in the hands of EU member states (and EU institutions), which are more autonomous in taking their decisions” (Voltolini 2013: 101). She maps nearly 300 groups active in EU foreign policy towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and three cases which present heavily lobbied arenas attracting different types of organised interests.
Second, Voltolini’s findings show that the majority of non-state advocates play a ‘consensual and median’ rather than ‘adversarial’ role which allows them to “establish cooperative interactions with EU officials and policymakers and develop a dialogue that can lead to the achievement of a shared understanding of the situation at stake” (Voltolini 2013: 251). The advocates also rely on ‘technical/legal frames’ when lobbying the EU, rather than on ‘political frames’ which are more recurrent in the EU member state lobbying along with more confrontational forms of social interaction (ibidem: 253). Additionally, analysing national level lobbying in the UK, France and Germany on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Voltolini finds a partial Europeanisation of lobbying by groups from the member states, though the EU and national level lobbying are seen as disentangled arenas in terms of roles and frames applied by the advocates which she
51

explains by differences between political systems in the EU and the member states.
Whereas Voltolini’s constructivist approach sees influence as a circular process in which both the EU institutions and non-state actors are “reciprocally affected by the social interactions they develop” (ibidem: 40), her findings add some fuel to the debate on who wins and loses in the sphere of EU lobbying. Voltolini shows that the most influential actors are those deeply embedded in the EU political system, who understand and adopt EU rules and norms and recognise EU legitimacy. What seems to matter is not the material resources which groups possess, but their readiness to learn and adapt to the EU rules and not challenge them. Furthermore, it appears from her study that interest group influence lays within the domain of providing technical and legal information to the EU rather than confronting EU strategic approaches towards foreign policy issues.
However, Voltolini does not examine the institutional determinants of lobbying. Her study says little about lobbying under the CFSP institutional set-up. Following the constructivist assumptions, Voltolini argues that interest groups do not adapt their advocacy strategies to venues which they lobby, but that their behaviour is a result of social interaction with policymakers (Voltolini 2013; Voltolini forthcoming). Thus, the choice of her cases studies is not driven by the variation of institutional contexts of lobbying. Instead, conceptualising the EU foreign policy after Hill (2003: 4) “as the sum of what the EU and its members states do in international relations”, Voltolini focuses on the most lobbied issues in EU policy towards the conflict. Two of these relate to EU trade policy towards Israel in which the Community method is applied and the groups studied in her research focus their lobbying on the Commission and the Parliament. The third case studies lobbying on the EU stance on the UN Report following the war in
52

Gaza of 2008-2009 which is an example of weakly institutionalised intergovernmental cooperation in the EU. It lies outside EU foreign policy as it has been defined for the purpose of the present study: there is no single EU seat at the UN and while member states do coordinate their positions at the UN, they are not obliged to vote as a block. Unsurprisingly, Voltolini does not say much about the lobbying of member states in the Council and devotes more attention to groups lobbying in the European Parliament and national governments via capitals. Though the EP does not have any powers on the issue, being open to different kinds of interests, it seems to serve as a locus for EU-level public debate. Lobbying at the EP in an intergovernmental setting is an interesting insight to develop through this thesis and uncover interest groups’ logic when lobbying less powerful venues which nevertheless give groups access and visibility. Given that Voltolini focuses on few groups in each case, mostly restricted to those based in Brussels or the EU member states, there is no insight into how non-state actors interact with EU institutions on the ground where EU policies are implemented.
Still, the findings generated by Voltolini on the dominance of non-confrontational roles and technical and legal frames in interest groups’ interactions with EU policymakers, especially the Commission and the Parliament speak to the findings of this research, as we will see further. They underline the dominance of inside lobbying and information on technical and legal issues provided by the groups to the EU institutions. The choice of the current thesis, nonetheless, is to apply rationalist assumptions and functional explanations of logic of access and influence, on which the main bulk of literature on interest groups and non-state actors participation in intergovernmental organisations has been developed. To this end I would like to contribute to the mainstream literature on interest groups in the EU and show that this theoretical approach can explain interest
53

groups’ involvement in EU foreign policymaking too, despite the little interest paid to the policy area in which intergovernmental politics prevails. The constructivist-driven explanations provided by Voltolini affirm that groups do not adapt strategically to advocacy venues, but that their lobbying strategies are a result of socialisation. Without questioning the validity of these findings on theoretical grounds, I argue that strategic adaptation plays a significant role in group lobbying strategies and can explain the variation of participation patterns. As we will see further, in the process of lobbying the EU groups can adapt how they formulate their preferences and choose lobbying tactics, but they do it strategically exploiting different opportunity structures, rather than changing their preferences and identities, as Voltolini has argued. Whereas socialisation and learning indeed play an important role in non-state actor lobbying and influence, I emphasise the instrumental and strategic character of lobbying both for groups and policymakers. In sum, by applying the rationalist lens, a more complete story of lobbying and influence in EU foreign policy can be narrated.
Conclusion
Interest groups have different roles to play in European integration depending on the theoretical lenses applied. Whereas intergovernmentalists limit the role of interest groups to the domestic level, neofunctionalists see interest groups as forming transnational coalitions and pushing together with supranational institutions for European integration to spill over new policy areas. The multi-level governance concept views interest groups as participating in decision-making at both national and European levels. However, the grand theories say little about interest group influence and how it is
54

exercised in the EU, unlike the interest group literature which attempts to tackle a challenging task of operationalising and measuring influence and examining its determinants. Students of influence focus mostly on Community policymaking (legislative policymaking on the former ‘first pillar’ issues), specific institutions (the European Commission and the European Parliament) and earlier stages of policymaking process. Few studies explore influence on intergovernmental policymaking, which still dominates certain areas of European integration such as foreign policy. This also partially explains why the focus of the literature on institutional determinants of influence remains limited to the lobbying of particular EU institutions, adaptation of lobbying strategies to the EU level of governance and comparison of the EU with other political systems. This study will try to add further material to fill this gap.
The underlying research question to be answered in this study is how and to what extent interest groups influence EU foreign policy. In carrying out this project, I hope to contribute to the two sets of literature in EU studies. First, this study intends to enrich the literature on interest groups in the EU. It will be a novelty in the research on interest group politics in the EU by focusing on a policy area in which member states still preserve strong and sometimes nearly exclusive competences and veto power. There is scarce research on how interest groups engage in intergovernmental decision-making in the EU such as the CFSP/CSDP.
This study will also add to the literature on interest group influence by attempting to measure it and explore the role of institutional determinants. By conceptualising EU foreign policy as multi-level and multi-pillar (Stephan Keukeleire & MacNaughtan 2008: 29-32) that includes not only CFSP, but also former first and third pillar issues (see also K. E. Smith 2003: 67), I will be able to examine the power of institutional
55

factors on interest group influence and how interest groups strategies are trying to adapt to different policy regimes in EU foreign policy.
Second, the study will be a valuable contribution to EU foreign policy studies, in which the role of interest groups remains largely an unexplored area. Most studies on EU foreign policy look at such actors as the Commission, member state governments, the European Parliament and national parliaments and the role of EU bureaucracy and diplomacy. Studying interest groups’ participation and influence is helpful in understanding how EU foreign policy is made. It is also important for addressing the issue of democratic legitimacy as the departure from intergovernmentism breaks the link with national procedures for accountability and authorization (Sjursen 2011). Though it is not a central task of my study, its findings will hopefully add a brick into this debate.
My point of departure asserts that intergovernmentalist theories cannot explain the increasing number of interest groups active in foreign policy area at the EU level. I argue that governance approaches to EU foreign policy better describe the nature of integration and policymaking in this area and interest group mobilization at the EU level. Multiplication of decision-making centres and actors (including non-state) involved, Europeanisation of national foreign policies, the role of informal arrangements, the role of norms and values and the constitution of identity of the EU as an actor in the international arena – these all go beyond the intergovernmentalist logic. However, while governance approaches, such as the multi-level governance concept, predict that interest groups mobilize at the EU level, they have nothing to say about how mobilisation translates into influence.
In turn, the interest group literature has developed a number of hypotheses on how
56

interest group influence is conditioned by a set of factors, including institutions which groups interact with. Bridging the assumptions about the degree of (multi-level) governance in EU foreign policy and the hypothesised relationship between interest group influence and political institutions, I will develop a set of hypotheses on interest groups influence in different areas across the multi-pillar and multi-level structure of widely defined EU foreign policy. In particular, by looking at three cases that represent different institutional set ups and decision-making modes (corresponding to the Community competences, the CFSP and the CSDP), I will examine how opportunity structures of a given policy case, in which interest groups involve, determine their success and how interest groups develop their strategies in order to minimise threats and maximise opportunities. Thus, this study does not only look into policy area of the EU which has received little scholar attention, but also adds to the debate on the institutional context of lobbying and influence in the EU. Theoretically my research draws on the growing body of interest group literature in the EU adopting its theoretical assumptions and developing and testing hypotheses relevant to the major scholarly debates. Thus, I accept the theoretical grounds upon which this literature has been built and which are presented in a greater detail in the next chapter.

Chapter 2. Theoretical framework and research design
Introduction
Interest group scholarship in the EU has mostly focused on groups’ involvement in the Community policy areas. In these areas, supranational institutions such as the Commission and the European Parliament appear the most lobbied targets in EU policymaking machinery due to their agenda-setting and decision-making powers and relative openness to interest groups (Coen & Richardson 2009; Greenwood 2007; Joachim & Locher 2009a). Furthermore, one can find patterns of pro-integration alliances between transnational interest groups and supranational institutions, as theorised by neofunctionalists (Haas 1968).
We know very little about the extent to which these patterns of interaction and group influence are present in other policy domains in which European integration has been less developed and the EU system of multi-level governance has arguably not yet emerged (Eising & Kohler-Koch 1999). EU foreign policy is one of such domains in which the dominance of the nation state and state actors has been largely resistant to the logic of neofunctionlist spillover. In this policy area in which intergovernmental arrangements have been left largely intact, one may expect that interest groups would rather act according to the ‘two-level games’ logic, lobbying their national governments and leaving them to represent their positions at the intergovernmental level. However, existing studies as well as the reality in Brussels show that interest groups do actively lobby EU foreign policy. This is in line with a shift in theorising EU foreign policy from intergovernmentalism towards the application of governance frameworks (M. Smith 2004b; Norheim-Martinsen 2010; Mérand et al. 2011; Cross 2011; Howorth 2012;
58

Kaunert & Leonard 2012) which expect interactions between public and private actors.
In addition to answering the underlying research question of this study “How and to what extent do interest groups influence EU foreign policy?” I also aim to contribute to scholarly debate on the determinants of influence by asking the question: “Do the institutional designs of the EU determine advocacy strategies and influence?”. The multi-level governance which has emerged in many areas of European integration is seen as conducive to interest groups’ involvement in policymaking, but what about policy areas in which European integration has not yet advanced so far? Is intergovernmentalism an insurmountable obstacle to interest group engagement? Or have groups found ways to (successfully) represent their interests at the EU level even in the areas ruled by the intergovernmental method of policymaking? Is our knowledge about lobbying and interest groups influence in the EU, which stems from the studies of communitarised policy areas, valid for EU foreign policy too?
Armed with these questions, this chapter outlines the main theoretical framework of this study which draws on the literature on interest groups in the EU and, more specifically, on the studies of influence. This study will aim to explore the relationship between institutional factors on the one hand, and interest group strategies and influence on the other. As was shown in Chapter 1, lobbying strategies and influence are seen to depend on the political institutions with which interest groups interact (Dür 2008a; Dür & De Bièvre 2007b; Mahoney 2008). However, studies trying to examine the role of institutional determinants in the EU are scarce and chiefly focus on the impact of the institutional context on groups influence on the Commission in the process of drafting legislative proposals (Bernhagen et al. 2015). Focusing on Community policymaking, interest groups scholars suffer from a single-case problem as the EU’s political system
59

is treated as a ‘sui generis’. By including intergovernmental policymaking in the study of lobbying and interest group influence, we add a variation on the institutional design which allows us comparing the EU with itself. Therefore, such a study is of added value to the bulk of interest groups literature, which has thus far focused on determinants of group influence.
EU foreign policy represents a useful case for studying the role of institutional factors as it provides a variety of institutional set-ups depending on a policy issue. I use the concept of EU foreign policy as multi-pillar and multi-level, which is not confined to the EU activities under the CFSP but encompasses the foreign policy developed across all former three pillars (Keukeleire & MacNaughtan 2008: 29-32; K. E. Smith 2003: 67). Keukeleire and MacNaughtan (2008) situate EU foreign policymaking between two regimes the ‘Community method’ and the ‘intergovernmental method’. The ‘Community method’ is a policy mode which dominates the vast majority of EU policies on which interest groups lobby, including trade and development cooperation. The ‘intergovernmental method’ is best represented by the CSFP/CSDP. In practice, there is a whole range of methods on the continuum between the two extremes, as foreign policy dossiers often involve both policy regimes (Keukeleire & MacNaughtan 2008: 67).
I use the type of policy regime as a key explanatory variable for interest group influence. The prime utility of Keukeleire’s and MacNaughtan’s typology is that it incorporates institutional characteristics such as access points, institutional receptivity to interest group involvement and decision-making procedures which have been identified by the literature to be factors determining interest group influence (Princen 2007; Princen & Kerremans 2008; Joachim & Locher 2009c; Dür & De Bièvre 2007b;
60

Mahoney 2008). It is hypothesised that the position of a policy issue on which interest groups lobby on the continuum between two policy regimes determines the degree of influence which they are likely to achieve. It is thus expected that the closer an issue lies to the intergovernmental extreme, the lower the degree of influence they are likely to achieve and that this policy regime will largely favour the groups defending the status quo rather than promoting policy change.
However, it may be the case that interest groups engage in multi-level lobbying on intergovernmental issues too and that their influence does not depend on the type of policy regime. First, groups make use of multiple venues that the EU system offers, including those which are more receptive to them. Second, rather than fixed institutional characteristics such as the type of policy method, more dynamic characteristics of political opportunity structures determine lobbying success or failure. The literature on social movements argues that the presence or absence of elite allies facilitates or constrains collective action (McAdam 1998). The literature on NSA participation in intergovernmental organisations indicates that demand for the resources and services of non-state actors opens up their institutions to outside groups. Thus, alliances with key policymakers may serve as an alternative explanation for interest group influence.
The chapter is structured as follows. First, I introduce key concepts used in this study such as interest groups, lobbying/advocacy, advocacy strategies and interest group influence. Second, I present the key findings regarding interactions between the EU institutions and interest groups which stem from studies on lobbying in the Community policy areas. I furthermore discuss how the institutional mosaic of EU foreign policy differs from that of Community policymaking and what specific EU foreign policy institutions are. Finally, I present the research design of this study. I set out the main
61

hypotheses which are tested in this study, key variables and their operationalisation, the choice of cases for a comparative analysis, methodology and data collection methods employed in this study.
1. Key concepts
1.1. Interest groups One of the first problems encountered by students of interest groups is that of definition. As Jordan, Halpin and Maloney point out, the study of interest groups requires a disambiguation of the concept (Jordan et al. 2004). The interest group literature uses various labels (e.g. interest organisations, special interest organisations, nongovernmental organisations, civil society organisations etc.) to mark different bodies representing societal interests. As a result, it is very difficult to draw general conclusions concerning the organisational structures, the functions, or the influence of interest groups (Beyers et al. 2008). To avoid this definition confusion, Beyers, Eising and Maloney introduce three key features to define an actor as an interest group: organisation, political interests and informality (2008: 1106). Based on these criteria, interest groups are aggregated individuals and/or organised forms of political behaviour aiming to influence policy outcomes, but normally not seeking public office or competing in elections. This definition is used in this thesis, and along with this term, I also use organised interests, advocacy groups, lobby groups, advocates as synonyms. In popular perceptions, the word ‘advocacy’ appears to take precedence when one wants to speak of citizens’ participation in policymaking, whereas the term ‘lobbying’ suggests a narrower sense of influencing policymaking from inside (a lobby!) and is arguably not
62

free of negative connotations associated with the lack of transparency and power of moneyed groups in politics. Such a differentiation seems to be borrowed from the US practice in which lobbying is regulated by the state and, in its legal definition, consists of a communication to legislators intended to influence specific legislation which means either a proposed or pending law or bill (Manzo 2001). In this context, advocacy is indeed used to refer to a broader phenomenon. Instead of addressing “specific legislation”, advocates focus on a broad policy issue and target non-legislative bodies too (executive, bureaucracy, courts) (ibidem). The California-based Center for Nonprofit Management concludes that most advocacy would not legally-speaking be considered lobbying. In legal terms, such a distinction is important as under the US Internal Revenue Service regulation most non-profit organisations are prohibited from lobbying, except to an “insubstantial degree”, otherwise, they endanger their tax exempt status for contributions made to them. As one US consultant for the non-profit sector summarised, “[a]dvocacy is more of a generic term, while lobbying has a legal definition and legal and/or tax consequences” (Hessenius 2007:5). As a result, ‘lobbying’ in the US barely refers to non-profit groups and rather refers to associations and consultancies representing the profit sector. Despite the fact that European practices of lobbying regulation differ from those of the US (Holman & Luneburg 2012), public perceptions appear to associate lobbying with for-profit associations and consultancy firms and to a lesser extent with the non-profit sector.5
In the academic literature, the terms ‘advocacy’ and ‘lobbying’, as well as ‘lobbyists’
5 According to the survey of European policy elites carried out by Penn, Schoen & Berland (PSB) in 2009, the word ‘lobbyist’ is first of all associated with trade associations (61%) and public affairs agencies (57%), while NGOs, trade unions and companies are less frequently mentioned as lobbyists (50%, 46% and 43% respectively). See Burson Marsteller, “A Guide to Effective Lobbying in Europe”, 2009. Accessed 17 July 2015 at http://www.oursocialmedia.com/wpcontent/uploads/effective-lobbying_light_07102009.pdf.

and ‘advocates’, are frequently used as synonyms. For example, in her book Mahoney (an American herself) uses advocacy and lobbying interchangeably: she speaks of the advocacy process ending up with a lobbying success (or lack of it), though she has chosen the word ‘advocacy’ for the title of her book (Mahoney 2008). I also use the terms synonymously.
This study covers interest groups based in the EU and non-EU countries, as well as international non-state actors. There is as yet little known about how foreign actors perceive and try to influence the EU (for an overview see Rasmussen & Alexandrova 2012: 615). A large-N study about foreign interest groups participating in the Commission’s consultations show that bias is in favour of actors from economically well-connected markets with high levels of resources (ibidem: 629). Nevertheless, we may expect that a broad variety of foreign interest groups try to engage with EU decision-makers on foreign policy issues. First, EU policies on a certain issue or towards a certain country affect the interests of foreign non-state actors too. Given the role of the EU on the global stage, many international non-state actors have an interest influencing EU foreign policy. Second, the EU policymakers are interested in expertise non-EU actors can potentially provide regarding their countries and regions of origin. Moreover, during recent years the EU has been involved in a structured dialogue with foreign interest groups on a number of issues such as foreign commercial policy, human rights, EU development and democracy aid policies.
1.2. Lobbying and advocacy strategies
Most definitions of lobbying underline influence on public policy as an ultimate goal. To this end one of the most quoted definitions in the literature views lobbying as “the informal exchange of information with public authorities, as a minimal conception on
64

the one hand, and as trying informally to influence public authorities, as a maximal description on the other hand” (Van Schendelen 1994: 3). In his later work, Van Schendelen defines lobbying even more broadly as “all sorts of unorthodox actions of interest groups intended to bring desired outcomes from government” (Van Schendelen 2007: 230, italic original).
Mahoney defines advocacy as a process that aims to influence public policy (Mahoney 2008):
The process is initiated with an advocate’s decision to mobilize for a political debate, at which point the advocate determines his or her position on the issue. Once the advocate choose to engage on an issue, a series of additional decisions need to be made about the advocacy strategy, including what arguments to use, what targets to approach, what direct or inside lobbying tactics to employ, what public education or outside lobbying tactics to engage in, and which allies to work with. The process concludes when the policy debates ends, and this determines the advocate’s lobbying success (many times leading to a new advocacy process because issues carry on through time). Mahoney underlines the many decisions interest groups have to make, which collectively compose an advocacy strategy as it is viewed in this study. Advocacy strategies are essentially approaches to seeking influence (Binderkrantz & Krøyer 2012: 124). The interest group literature distinguishes between inside and outside lobbying (Kollman 1998; Mahoney 2008), or access and voice strategies, in other typology (Beyers 2004).
Inside lobbying, or access strategies, targets the venues where political bargaining takes place, for example, advisory bodies, technical committees, agencies and, to certain
65

extent, parliamentary committees (Beyers 2004: 213). Access strategies are better suited to the transmission of operational and technical information (ibidem). Inside lobbying tactics include participating in hearings, consultations; drafting legislation and amendments; sending position papers, letters and faxes; personal meetings with policymakers and their staff; presenting research to government; serving on public advisory boards; participating in litigation over policy; organizing cocktail parties, seminars and conferences, and other similar activities (Kollman 1998: 35; Mahoney 2008: 127).
Voice strategies, or outside lobbying, such as media campaigns or protests, relate to activities taking place in various public spheres, where the communication among societal interests, policymakers and citizens becomes visible to a broader audience (Beyers 2004: 213). Outside lobbying organized by interest groups aims at “mobiliz[ing] citizens outside the policymaking community to contact or pressure public officials inside the policymaking community” (Kollman 1998: 3). So the message an interest group wants to convey is not channelled to policymakers directly, unlike in the case of inside lobbying. Voice strategies are less effective for the transmission of technical and detailed information and, if access is gained, it is less costly to communicate information directly to policymakers (Beyers 2004: 2014). Outside lobbying tactics range from public advertisement and talking with the press, holding press conferences, organizing letter-writing campaigns, publicizing voting records of elected officials, to grass roots meetings to demonstrations and protests. Some scholars also make a further distinction between media (information politics) and protest strategies (Beyers 2004; Binderkrantz & Krøyer 2012), indicating their different uses within outside lobbying.
66

Another distinction concerns the number of levels to be targeted by interest groups. Lobbying strategies may focus on one, two or more levels (domestic, which may include local, regional and national; EU level and international level to include international organisations such as the UN or international negotiations). With regards to EU foreign policy this distinction is important, as interest groups may play the logic of two-level games in international politics (Putnam 1988), lobbying their national governments and leaving them to represent their positions at the intergovernmental level. However, a growing number of students of EU foreign policy point out that even security and defence policy that has long been a domaine réservé of the member states moves beyond intergovernmentalism (Norheim-Martinsen 2010; Sjursen 2011) towards (multi-level/supranational) governance (Mérand et al. 2011; Kaunert & Leonard 2012; Howorth 2012). Thus, we expect interest groups to be increasingly involved in multilevel advocacy at both member state and EU level. In the interest group literature such advocacy is termed multi-level venue shopping (Beyers & Kerremans 2012).
Birkland defines venue shopping as “the efforts groups undertake to gain a hearing for their ideas and grievances against existing policy” and a venue as “a level of government or institution in which the group is likely to gain the most favourable hearing” (Birkland 2007: 69). Venues can be seen horizontally as different institutions at the same level (legislature, executive or judiciary, or different institutions or bodies within the EU system) or vertically, as levels of governance (international, EU, national, subnational, local).
Multi-level (vertical) venue shopping depends on many factors, such as domestic political context, group characteristics and collective beliefs and values, as the literature points out. As far as institutional characteristics are concerned, groups, first of all, lobby
67

more receptive venues (Guiraudon 2000; Princen 2007) and those more proximate to them (Beyers & Kerremans 2012).
Venue shopping is mostly applied in agenda-setting studies (Baumgartner & Jones 1993; Pralle 2003; Princen 2009; Stephenson 2012) and closely linked to the concept of issue framing: “[d]ifferent issues may be assigned to one venue rather than another because of how they are framed” and “different venues reinforce different ways of considering the issue” (Baumgartner 2007: 484). Baumgartner and Jones (1993) theorise that policy change occur when actors shift debates and decision-making on a policy issue to new venues which are more susceptible to alternative definition of issue than ‘old’ venues (Princen 2009: 27). Venue shifting often requires issue redefinition, as “changes in image are used purposefully, in an effort to attract the attention of the members of a particular venue” (Baumgartner and Jones 1993: 36, quoted in Pralle 2003: 242). Issue framing is about highlighting some dimensions of an issue and downplaying others (Princen 2009: 34).
Venue shopping and issue framing are important components of advocacy strategies, at least at the initial stages of policymaking, though issues are constantly redefined and policies are reviewed and modified which means these elements are continuously present in the advocacy process. In the context of EU foreign policy it implies that national groups, if they are unsuccessful in advocating their cause at home or for normative reasons, may seek venues at the EU level and frame their issues in a way to demand European policy action.
1.3. Interest group influence
Studies on interest group influence in the EU most often conceptualise influence as an actor’s ability to reach desired policy outcomes. For example, in a special issue of the
68

Journal of Public Policy (2007, 27:1) dedicated to interest group influence, the authors conceptualise ‘influence’ as control over policy outcomes, following Jeffrey Hart’s suggestion, as opposed to influence as control over resources and control over actors (Hart 1976). As a political outcome can come in the form of the official position taken by public authorities or the actual implementation of that policy (Dür & De Bièvre 2007b: 3), this approach assumes that actors have clear preferences over outcomes that do not change in the course of interaction with other actors. Though this limits possible research outcomes, the “influence as control over outcomes” approach is argued to be “the epistemologically most sound and empirically most pragmatic route towards assessing interest groups influence” (ibidem). Such conceptualisation of influence is adopted for the purpose of this study. Below, I briefly discuss its benefits and limitations as well as other ways of seeing influence and power in the policymaking process.
Hart (1976) argued that the conceptualisation of power as a control over events and outcomes is superior to two other approaches for the measurement of power in international politics, namely power as a control over resources and power as a control over actors. According to Hart, power as a control over resources has a number of limitations. It is not clear whether actors will be able to use their resources and what types of resources are crucial to affect the outcomes of a conflict. Furthermore, some types of resources are difficult to measure. Lastly, such a conceptualization of power does not allow us to deal with interdependence, coalitions, and collective action (Hart 1976: 290). Adopting Hart’s argument, interest group influence cannot be conceptualised as access or institutionalised participation in the decision making process or structural power of business actors. Indeed, empirical studies on lobbying in the EU show that access does not necessarily lead to the achievement of interest groups’
69

objectives (Dür & De Bièvre 2007a; Bugdahn 2008), whilst business groups do not always define policy outcomes, and the context specific conditions matter (Woll 2007; Michalowitz 2007; Dür & Mateo 2014a; Dür et al. 2015; Rasmussen 2015). Dür argues that access or structural power are pathways to influence rather than actual influence, calling on researchers to make cautious claims about group influence or lack of thereof, unless possible pathways to influence have been taken into account (Dür 2008: 1223).
Power conceptualised as control over actors is based on Robert Dahl’s (1961) definition of power as the ability of A to get B to do something which he would otherwise not do (behavioural approach). Hart argues that the main problem with this definition of power is that it is difficult to obtain information to measure power given the highly psychological nature of power relations (Hart 1976: 293). Thus, control over outcomes is seen as the preferable form of conceptualisation given the measurement issues.
Another benefit of conceptualising interest group influence as control over policy outcomes is that researchers have developed and tested methods of measuring it. Process-tracing, assessing attributed influence and gauging the degree of preference attainment have been most frequently applied in the literature (Dür 2008a; Dür 2008b). I have been able to use the accumulated knowledge on the methodology of measuring influence in this research (see Section 3.3).
When measuring interest group influence, I focus primarily on the ‘first’, a more observable, face of power while being aware of other rather invisible manifestations of it. Criticising Dahl’s approach to the observation of power by establishing who wins and who loses on a certain issue, Bacharch and Baratz point to the ‘second face of power’, namely a power to keep unwanted issues off the agenda (Bachrach & Baratz 1962). In his three-dimensional view of power, Lukes goes further, speaking of power as an
70

actor’s capacity to prevent other actors from recognising their real interests (Lukes 1974; Lukes 2005). However, the difficulty Lukes himself recognised is that of empirically ascribing real interests to social actors, especially given that these interests are not “unitary or dual, but multiple and conflicting” (Lukes 2005: 145). As a result the study of the second and the third dimensions of power is seen as extremely difficult (Dür 2008a), for the former takes into account non-decisionmaking and the latter also focuses on latent (unobservable) conflict “which consists in a contradiction between the interests of those exercising power and the real interests of those they exclude” (Lukes 2005: 28, italics in original). A potential solution suggested by Dür is to “consciously focus on specific aspects of the concept, therefore making it amenable to empirical research”, rather than to “conced[e] defeat” in the face of the difficulties of conceptualisation (Dür 2008: 1221).
Conceptualisation of influence as control over policy outcomes stands closest to relational power in the typology of power in policymaking developed by Arts & Van Tatenhove (2004). Relational power “concerns the capacity of agents to ‘name’ and ‘frame’ societal problems as political and policy problems, and to mobilise resources to formulate and realise the most desirable solutions. In doing so, policy agents may decide to ‘do things otherwise’, and renew policymaking, either by overruling ‘conservative forces’ that defend the status quo (transitive power), or by collectively changing rules of the game and/or policy discourses (intransitive power)” (ibidem: 351). Thus, it does not account for dispositional power which reflects positions of agents in organisations mediated by rules and resources and “these positions co-determine what agents may achieve in terms of relational power” (ibidem: 350). It is also different from structural power which is “the way macro-societal structures shape the nature and
71

conduct of agents, being both individuals and collectivities (organisations)” (ibidem). Arts and Verschuren also make an explicit distinction between “power as the general ability to influence” and “influence as the realisation of a single effect” (Arts & Verschuren 1999: 413), while other use two concepts as synonyms (Dür 2008a). In this thesis, I adopt the latter approach.
2. Institutional context of lobbying and influence in the EU
2.1. Lobbying EU institutions Comparative studies of lobbying in different political systems demonstrate that the particular characteristics of institutions with which groups interact affect both lobbying strategies and influence (Mahoney 2008; Joachim & Locher 2009c). However, these studies say little about how lobbying and influence vary within the EU depending on the institutional framework in which groups try to influence policymaking. The focus of prevailing research on lobbying on issues that belong to the former first (Community) pillar does not allow for this kind of analysis. We know from the literature that the Commission and the European Parliament are the most lobbied EU institutions due to their relative openness to interest groups, whereas the Council remains more closed to outside interests (Coen & Richardson 2009; Greenwood 2007; Joachim & Locher 2009a). Unsurprisingly, the Commission is the most popular research focus for scholars studying lobbying in the EU (see Bunea & Baumgartner 2014), with the emerging studies focusing on the European Parliament reflecting the gradual empowerment of this
72

institution by the subsequent treaties.
Given the Commission’s right of legislative initiative, this institution has always been a target for interest groups. Its organisational ideology has pushed the Commission to develop an EU level interest group system (Mazey & Richardson 2006: 279). The Commission’s symbiotic relationship with interest groups is driven by its need for technical information and advice and the support of cross-national advocacy coalitions for the introduction of the Commission’s proposals (ibidem: 280). As Mazey and Richardson point out, by demonstrating openness to societal interests the Commission enhances its own legitimacy. Given the Commission’s role as a legal guardian, early involvement of interest groups is also instrumental for smooth implementation of the Commission’s proposals once they become legislative acts (Tanasescu 2009: 56). Moreover, consultations with interest groups is a legal obligation for the Commission stated in the Protocol No. 7 to the Amsterdam Treaty and, recently, the Lisbon Treaty. The latter stresses that “the Commission shall carry out broad consultations with parties concerned in order to ensure that the Union’s actions are coherent and transparent” (quoted in Tanasescu 2009: 58). The Commission has gradually institutionalized its consultative practices outlining the main principles and norms in a number of documents (e.g. White Paper on European Governance of 2001, General principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission of 2002). The Commission and European Parliament took steps to increase the transparency of lobbying in the EU by establishing a joint Transparency Register in 2011, in which voluntary registration of interest representatives is incentivised by a promise of greater inclusion in consultation schemes and 12 months accreditation for a 1-day access pass to the EP (Greenwood & Dreger 2013: 142). Moreover, organised groups can submit
73

proposals for legislation to the European Commission in the sphere of its competences via the European Citizens Initiative – “the world’s first transnational participatory mechanism” (Bouza Garcia & Greenwood 2014: 247) .
The Commission shapes EU-level interest representation by funding the activities of certain groups (favouring diffuse interests, organised at the EU level and promoting European identity, democracy and civic engagement, see Mahoney & Beckstrand 2011) and by institutionalizing consultation practices (see Tanasescu 2009) and extensively relying on committee governance (Bouwen 2009). This goes in line with the neofunctionalist prediction that supranational institutions and transnational interest groups will ally to promote further integration.
With a gradual expansion of its budgetary and legislative powers since the early 1990s, the European Parliament (EP) has become a popular target for lobbyists (Kohler-Koch 1997; Lehmann 2009). As directly elected representatives, members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are more open to these groups that “either represent a broad constituency such as trade unions, social movements, or political parties, or those that can provide them with an aggregate view on the most efficient ways to deal with the problems and economic consequences” (Lehmann 2009: 58). Interest groups play an important role in transmitting and translating “often complex and technical information into accessible data for busy elected representatives” (Earnshaw & Judge 2002: 63).
The EP appears as both a national and European route of interest representation as MEPs have contacts with national interest groups from their countries and European level groups (Wessels 1999; Bouwen 2004b). The EP is the only institution attentive to outside strategies that are more often deployed by civil society organisations (Eising 2007a).
74

The alignment of parties and interest groups in the EP reflects a left-right cleavage familiar at the national level. Business tends to side with Christian democrats, conservatives and liberals, whereas NGOs are strongly aligned with Social democrats, the left parties and the Greens (Beyers et al. 2015). Still, groups lobby non-natural allies if they hold influential positions: if they are members of the largest political groups, members of policy relevant committees and active legislators (Marshall 2015). Interest groups also lobby EP Secretariat officials as another pathway to influence rapporteurs (Marshall 2012) and influential committee members during the open amendments phase (Marshall 2010).
The lobbying of MEPs may not be a goal in itself but a way to reach other institutions, the Commission and the Council (Kohler-Koch 1997). This can be especially the case for EU foreign policy in which interest organisations and the EP form a “coalition of the weak”, as Kohler-Koch puts it.
The Council of the EU and European Council are considered the “least accessible” institutions, though “not inaccessible” (Hayes-Renshaw 2009) and less lobbied (Greenwood 2007). First, the Council’s role is crucial at the later stages of the legislation-making process when there is less possibility to shape the EU acquis (see Klüver 2013). Second, the Council primarily deals with ‘high-politics’ issues that involve inter-state bargaining, thus making it extremely difficult to influence decisionmaking processes. It is also clear that interest representation in the Council’s machinery remains largely unresearched (Greenwood 2007: 28).
The difficulty in approaching the Council is due to several features that distinguish this institution from the other two. Despite the efforts to improve transparency, the atmosphere of secrecy remains deeply embedded in the Council’s work (Hayes-
75

Renshaw 2009: 73; Hayes-Renshaw & Wallace 2006: 67). The Lisbon Treaty requires the Council to “meet in public when it deliberates and votes on a draft legislative act” (TEU Art. 16(8)). This constitutes a change compared to the pre-Lisbon situation where only the discussion of the legislation under co-decision was subjected to public meeting, whereas Council’s transparency in this regard was regulated through its Rules of Procedure which could be amended by simple majority voting (Peers 2008). Since the Lisbon Treaty “[t]he opening to the public of Council meetings relating to the ‘Legislative deliberations’ part of its agenda shall be made through public transmission by audiovisual means, notably in an overflow room and through broadcasting in all official languages of the institutions of the European Union using video-streaming” (Council 2009, Art. 7(2)).
However, this transparency provision does not extend to non-legislative acts, which constitute the majority of EU foreign policy decisions (e.g. CFSP decisions, Council declarations). The Council’s Rules of Procedure merely envisage that the results of votes related to external action and the CFSP shall be made public by a unanimous Council or the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) decision taken at the request of one of their members, which in practice may appear as difficult to achieve as an adoption of the decision itself. In general, the Council decided that its deliberations “shall be covered by the obligation of professional secrecy, except in so far as the Council decides otherwise” (ibidem, Art. 6 (1). There is no such a thing as a transparency register regulating access to the Council or institutionalised consultation practices.
This body is governed by many informal rules for the sake of efficiency and consensus building; and, for example, when voting does not take place it is more difficult for
76

lobbyists to know the parties’ positions and the extent to which promises given to interest groups have been kept (Hayes-Renshaw 2009: 75). The Council is a multilayered institution that includes not only ministers from twenty eight members states that gather in different configurations, but a network of preparatory bodies such as committees and working groups also consisting of national representatives of all member states. As Hayes-Renshaw points out, even for a resource-rich interest organization it is costly to monitor “the detailed work of hundreds of actors and multiple layers” (ibidem: 74). Frequent rotation and the fact that many national representatives in the Council and its bodies are not based in Brussels is another obstacle to the building of the long-term personal relationships necessary for effective lobbying (ibidem: 75). Finally, EU level groups find it difficult to gain access to the Council because, essentially, it is a part of a national route of interest representation (Greenwood 2007: 27). Indeed, empirical studies of business lobbying show that national business associations and important national firms have better access to the Council than EUwide associations (Bouwen 2004a: 357).
These obstacles do not mean that interest groups do not approach the Council and its bureaucracy. There are various ways in which the Council can be accessed: there are some practices of giving access to the Council to selected groups (e.g. dinners with environmental NGOs within the margins of Environmental Council’s meetings, Tripartite Social Summit preceding the European Council meetings dedicated to the Lisbon agenda); through the national governments, including permanent representations in Brussels; through the Council’s presidency which play an important role in setting the Council’s agenda; through the Secretariat bureaucracy that assists the Council work; and through the Council’s preparatory bodies in which real work takes place (Hayes-
77

Renshaw 2009).
The Court of Justice of the European Union (EUCJ) is seen as “a highly successful venue in which to seek policy change and many organized interest have long cultivated strategies for targeting it, albeit with varied success” (McCown 2009: 89). While there are hardly any studies concerning choices of combination of lobbying or/and litigation strategies by interest groups in the EU, it is hypothesized that litigation strategies are likely to be pursued by narrowly focused and well resource-endowed interest groups in a situation when the EU fails to produce legislation (Bouwen & McCown 2007). Litigation may empower individuals and groups who are often disadvantaged in their own systems (Cichowski 2007: 6). On the one hand, judicial rulings “may create new rights for individuals or groups that can enable direct access or be utilized by movement activists to make subsequent claims through litigation”; on the other, the EUCJ decisions “may change the rules and procedures in a way that makes the policy process a more open to a particular group” (Cichowski 2007: 11). The EUCJ in its turn benefits from litigation as the clarification and construction of new EU rules is instrumental in strengthening the Court’s position in EU rulemaking (Cichowski 2007). Organised interests use the EUCJ preliminary reference mechanism to challenge national legislation and practices with which they do not agree (McCown 2009: 93). Litigation strategies are often reinforced by lobbying efforts in which groups provide technical expertise to rule-makers, frame policy issues and raise the awareness among new potential litigants (McCown 2009; Cichowski 2007; Bouwen & McCown 2007).
2.2. Institutional mosaic of EU foreign policy
Lobbying patterns described in the previous section take place in the institutional design of EU legislation making, whereas a large part of EU foreign policy is conducted
78

outside this framework. Keukeleire and MacNaughtan situate EU foreign policymaking roughly between two regimes: the ‘Community method’ and the ‘intergovernmental method’. The Community method is “operationalized through a system designed to maintain institutional equilibrium between a supranational Commission which has a key role in defining and defending common interests; a Council of Ministers with representatives of the member states which decides by majority voting on a wide range of decisions; a directly elected EP; and a supranational ECJ. The Community method applies to trade, development cooperation, humanitarian aid and other competences that fall under the EC” (Keukeleire & MacNaughtan 2008: 67).
Under the intergovernmental method “governments retain control over policymaking” which may take the form of intergovernmental cooperation or intergovernmental integration (ibidem). The former implies cooperation and coordination of national foreign policy within the EU framework. The latter means that member states have transferred competences to the EU but still control policymaking through the dominant position of the Council and the rule of unanimity in its decision-making. CFSP/CSDP is an example of the intergovernmental method (ibidem). However, in practice, there is a range of methods on the continuum between these two, as foreign policy dossiers often involve both policymaking regimes (Keukeleire & MacNaughtan 2008: 67).
These two regimes correspond to what Helen Wallace (2010) distinguishes as the regulatory mode and intensive transgovernmentalism, according to her typology of five policy modes in the EU. Wallace asserts that the regulatory mode is the most widespread policy mode in the EU, in which the Commission is the principle agendasetter, while the Council and the Parliament are involved as co-legislators and the role of EUCJ is significant, in addition to that of regulatory agencies at European and
79

national levels. The regulatory mode offers an “extensive opportunity for stakeholders, especially economic actors, but sometimes other societal actors, to be consulted about, and to influence, the shape and content of European market rules” (Wallace 2010: 96). In Wallace’s classification, this policy mode applies to competition, single market, environment, new aspects of trade and the common agriculture policy (CAP), and aspects of social and employment policies. At the other extreme, there is intergovernmental policy cooperation between national policymakers with little involvement by the EU institutions. Wallace terms it ‘intensive transgovernmentalism’ as it better corresponds to “the greater intensity and denser structuring [...], where member states governments have been prepared cumulatively to commit themselves to rather extensive engagement and disciplines, but have judged the full institutional framework to be inappropriate or unacceptable, or not yet ripe for adoption” (Wallace 2010: 101). The policy process is dominated by the Council of Ministers, with the active involvement of the European Council in setting the policy direction. The Commission’s involvement is limited, while the Parliament and ECJ are excluded. The policy process is not transparent to national parliaments and citizens. CFSP/CDSP is an illustration of this policy mode. Wallace visualises the two policy modes (see Table 1) describing the roles played by the EU institutions, member state governments and other actors in each of them.

Wallace underlines that these policy modes are ideal types, whereas “individual policy areas do not fall neatly within a single policy mode and there is strong variation over time, both within policy sectors and in response to events and contexts” (Wallace 2010: 91). Studying EU foreign policy through the prism of policy modes allow us to understand how policy is made, what kind of actors participate in it and, to a certain degree, what kind of policy outcomes one may expect. This approach also helps us to look beyond state actors in the policymaking process and to examine the participation of non-state actors in EU foreign policy.

I build on the assumption derived from the existing literature that the Community method is relatively open to interest group involvement and influence (Eising & KohlerKoch 1999), while the intergovernmental mode is least favourable to them (Mérand et

81

al. 2011 on CSDP; Uçarer 2009 on JHA). Thus, as we will see further in this chapter, this research is designed to explore whether involvement and influence of interest groups varies, increasing the closer a policy dossier is to the Community method, and decreasing the stronger intergovernmental arrangements are.
2.3. EU foreign policy machinery
In EU foreign policy, in order to bring their issues onto the agenda or influence decision-making, interest groups have to deal with a different institutional environment which may be less conducive to their involvement. Still, the dynamic institutional changes in EU foreign policy offer multiple venues which groups can approach. This section overviews EU foreign policy machinery which forms part of the institutional context in which groups lobby.
The Commission’s role in EU foreign policy varies significantly according to the issue at hand. It has an exclusive right to set the EU’s trade agenda policy, negotiate international trade and other agreements, and manage EU foreign aid and preparation of EU aspiring countries to the accession. Before the Lisbon Treaty, the Commission’s role in CFSP was limited to the non-exclusive right of initiative, which since the Lisbon Treaty is tied to the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR): the Commission may support the HR initiatives on CFSP or submit joint proposals (Piris 2010: 263). Furthermore, the Commission is involved in implementation of CFSP decisions, given that they require Union (formerly Community) measures (e.g. some types of sanctions), or EU funding. The External Relations family within the Commission (Commissioners and their respective Directorates General (DGs) dealing with international cooperation and development; humanitarian aid and civil protection; neighbourhood and enlargement; and trade) is the
82

main venue for groups with interest in EU foreign policy.
The EP’s involvement in EU foreign policy is largely consultative, with real powers limited to a budget veto, consent for international agreements covering fields to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies and the holding to account of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in the capacity of a Vice-President of the Commission. The Parliament has a number of institutional venues on EU foreign affairs potentially attractive for interest groups, which include the Committees on Foreign Affairs, on Development, on International Trade, Subcommittees on Human Rights and Security and Defence as well as Committees on Budgets and on Budgetary Control. The EP develops its international contacts with counterparts in third countries through dozens of delegations to parliamentary assemblies and joint parliamentary committees. The EP takes an active position on a wide range of foreign policy issues adopting non-binding resolutions, publishing reports and studies, organising public hearings and other events, and posing parliamentary questions to other institutions.
Whereas the Council is regarded by some scholars as a part of a national route of interest representation (Greenwood 2007), it is argued that its working bodies and bureaucracy with a permanent presence in Brussels have through ‘normative socialization processes’ developed ‘a trans-European strategic culture’, ‘a supranational culture’ emerging from an intergovernmental process (see Howorth 2011 on the Political and Security Committee; see also Cross 2011 on transnational epistemic communities of COREPER and CSDP bodies). Thus, it is to be expected that EU-level interest groups will also approach the Council bodies, though relying primarily on normative arguments and bringing forward European values, as opposed to national interest groups which
83

mainly transmit information limited to one member state.
The Lisbon Treaty created new institutions to represent the EU abroad and manage its external relations. The Permanent President of the European Council chairs the summit of heads of state and governments which became an EU institution in the Lisbon Treaty with a strategic role in EU foreign policy. The Permanent President ensures external representation of the EU on CFSP issues, “without prejudice to the powers of the High Representative” (for an overview see Piris 2010). In practice, the first Permanent President Herman Van Rompuy took an active stance on foreign policy issues (e.g. launching the EU’s strategic partnership debate), though he was seldom involved in the CSDP (Helwig et al. 2013: 19).
The High Representative (HR) of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy has become ‘triple-hatted’ carrying out tasks formerly attributed to the High Representative for CFSP/Secretary General of the Council, the Commissioner for External Affairs and the President of the External Relations Council. As Vice-President of the Commission, the HR ensures consistency and coordination regarding all aspects of the Union’s external action (Piris 2010: 244). The new representative also acquired new tasks involving agenda-setting, implementation and coordination of foreign policy issues as well external representation of the Union, which transforms her “from an assistant to a manager for the whole range of European external action” (Rüger 2012: 155).
The HR exercises authority over the European External Action Service (EEAS), EU Special Representatives and Delegations abroad. The EEAS is a functionally autonomous body of the EU, separate from the General Secretariat of the Council and from the Commission, with its own budget. It has been composed of officials previously working in the Council Secretariat (former Policy Unit, CSDP and crisis
84

management structures, Directorate-General E) and the Commission (DG External Relations) and seconded from the Member States foreign ministries (see Laursen 2012: 189-190). Thus, at least two different organizational cultures are expected in the EEAS: the Commission’s culture imbued with ‘supranational ethos’ and interpretation of ‘common interest’ (more integrated institutional culture) and an institutional culture of the Council Secretariat and diplomats of the member states with practices of intergovernmental negotiation and meditation spirit (more negotiated culture) (Carta 2012: 152). This implies that openness to non-state actors will depend on a policy issue: in such areas as crisis management the prevalence of the Council Secretariat routines is anticipated (Duke 2012: 58-59), making the work of advocates more difficult.
In the post-Lisbon EU, the Commission’s delegations abroad were upgraded to represent the Union, which boosts their political role. The delegations have also strengthened their political sections and attempted to coordinate the actions of the member states’ embassies in the third countries (Helwig et al. 2013).
The EEAS is tasked to support the HR, the Council and the Commission, as well as to serve the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission in exercising their external representation functions. This boosts the EEAS’s political role in the EU’s external policies as the service appears as “a bridge-builder between the institutions, sharing information and acting as a common source of expertise” and has the potential to become “a true inter-institutional ‘decision-shaping body’, working towards greater coherence in EU external action” (Blockmans & Laatsit 2012: 157). The EEAS functions are multiple: it plays a role of “a Presidency, diplomatic service, ministry of development and defence, as well as coordinating overall coherence of external action” (Helwig et al. 2013: 7). We may expect that the EEAS becomes a
85

central lobbying target for foreign policy advocates at the EU level. To conclude, EU foreign policy machinery differs from other areas of EU policymaking. First, the Lisbon Treaty did not overcome the dichotomy between the former first and second pillars. The CFSP remains largely intergovernmental with no revolutionary changes made. As one scholar put it, “[t]he role of the Member States in definition and decision-making process of CFSP still is huge and clear; in the area of implementation and representation, however, supranational level becomes more influential” (Radtke 2012: 52). The key EU institutions – the Commission, the Parliament and the Council of Ministers – have different decision-making roles in EU foreign policy, depending on whether a policy issue is dealt with through the Community or intergovernmental method. This is expected to impact upon interest group engagement with these institutions. Second, there are a number of institutions specific to EU foreign policy established or reformed by the Lisbon Treaty. They include the institutionalised European Council and its Permanent President, the ‘new’ High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to overcome the first/second pillar dichotomy, the EEAS which is to support not only the HR, but other institutions on the issues related to foreign policy and representation. We might assume that these new institutions are targets to advocates on EU foreign policy, though to varying degrees given their respective roles and receptivity.
3. Research design
3.1. Hypotheses and key variables As we know from the few studies on EU foreign policy lobbying, interest groups seem
86

to advocate the EU across a variety of issues ranging from the ‘communitarised’ area of international trade to the intergovernmental security and defence. The EU Transparency Register provides additional evidence of groups with interest in the latter domain. However, the question remains of the extent to which limited communitarisation and the intergovernmental character of a major part of EU foreign policy decision-making restricts interest groups involvement and influence.
We know from the interest group literature that political opportunity structure defined as “the set of characteristics of a given institution that determines the relative ability of (outside) groups influence decision making within that institution” (Princen & Kerremans 2008: 1130) determines both interest group strategies and the likelihood of influence. One of the key institutional characteristics affecting influence, though not determinant, is access granted by policymakers to interest groups (Dür & De Bièvre 2007b; Dür & De Bièvre 2007a). Access means “either a successful attempt of an interest group to approach the EU institutions or the incorporation of an interest group into EU policymaking by these institutions” (Eising 2007b: 386).
Multi-level governance in the EU multiplies the number of access points for interest groups, providing them with better chances to be heard (Jachtenfuchs & Kohler-Koch 2004; Hooghe & Marks 2001). Groups can venue shop navigating between different access points at national, EU or even international level (Princen 2007; Princen & Kerremans 2008). But not all access points are equal in terms of their openness and receptivity to outsider inputs (Joachim & Locher 2009a). In the EU, the Commission and the Parliament are more open to interest groups, while the Council is the least accessible, given the secretive culture of intergovernmental decision-making (Coen & Richardson 2009). So, hypothetically, interest groups are likely to exert influence when
87

they deal with the Commission (or former Commission’s units within the EEAS) and the Parliament than with the Council. In EU foreign policymaking, if an issue at stake is to be decided on the basis of consensus by the EU intergovernmental institutions and implemented by the member state governments (the intergovernmental method), interest groups are less likely to achieve influence than, if the supranational institutions are involved in policymaking and implementation and the Council decides by QMV (the Community method). This informs our first hypothesis:
H1 (institutional set-up – degree of influence): On the continuum between the Community method and the intergovernmental method of decision-making in EU foreign policy, interests groups are likely to achieve higher degrees of influence for an issue which lies closer towards the Community method; and are likely to achieve lower degrees of influence for an issue which is situated closer to the intergovernmental extreme.
As presented above, institutional characteristics may change over time with the changes of the Treaties, however, they are relatively static. A more dynamic characteristic of political opportunity structures identified by literature on social movements and interest groups is the presence or absence of elite allies which facilitates or constrains collective action. As Baumgartner puts it, “[m]any of those acting as policy advocates are in fact government officials themselves, acting as allies of others and sharing their interests” (Baumgartner 2007: 483). This statement finds confirmation in Joachim and Dembinski’s case study of lobbying on a CSDP issue: a shift of Great Britain and France to the camp of supporters of European Code of Conduct in Arms Exports made NGO lobbying easier and more influential (Joachim & Dembinski 2011: 1159). In Great Britain this shift came as a result of a change of government, whereas in France it was
88

driven by strategic government calculations (ibidem). Moreover, from the literature on NSA access to international organisations, we also know that some bodies are more open to non-state actors due to their functional needs (Steffek 2010; Tallberg et al. 2014). They rely on information which non-state actors provide or other services.
Therefore, it is hypothesised that alliances with key decision-makers may facilitate interest groups influence on EU policy, even if the case upon which they lobby is close to the intergovernmental method. In other words, interest groups are likely to achieve their goals if they have allies among key decision-makers such as the member states in the Council, the HR or a member state holding the presidency (for non-CFSP issues), the EEAS and the Commission (when it is involved in policy formulation on the nonCFSP issues or implementation), and the EP if it has any powers. Allies here are understood broadly: they may be ideological allies sharing the same position, or the same objective, or they may simply have overlapping interests with groups.
H2 (alliance building – degree of influence): If interest groups have allies among key decision-makers, they are likely to achieve higher degrees of influence.
We can also expect that policy regime has an impact on a type of influence groups try to achieve. Namely, we distinguish between organised interests defending the status quo and those promoting change. It is expected that it will be more difficult to promote change under intergovernmental policymaking arrangements. In line with an intergovernmentalist account, the member states tend to adopt foreign policy decisions based on the lowest common denominator, which implies a policy of “the status quo (agreement not to change an existing policy) or a new policy that reflects the preferences of the veto player” (Thomas 2011: 20-22; see also Jupille 1999; Meunier 2000). By this logic, if the Council decides unanimously, efforts of national interest
89

groups from one member state will suffice to block the decision and protect the status quo. If the Council decides by QMV, a coordinated effort of national groups from a blocking minority member states is needed to keep the status quo.
H3 (institutional set-up – type of influence). The intergovernmental method of policymaking mostly favours groups that defend the status quo rather than promoting change.
At the same time, studies show that the lowest common denominator is not always the case and other theoretical frameworks are better in providing an explanation for EU foreign policy decisions (M. E. Smith 2004a; Thomas 2011b), whereas status quo defenders are more likely to achieve success in the Community policy areas too (Bunea 2013; Mahoney 2007). In this case, we will not see a clear win for groups protecting the status quo over those pushing for change as the closer an issue lies to the intergovernmental extreme.
Given that the number of interest groups with interest in foreign policy is growing (as illustrated by the EU Transparency Register) and that even the most intergovernmental parts of EU foreign policy such as the CSDP can be viewed through the prism of (multilevel) governance frameworks characterised by heterarchy, or the existence of multiple centres of power; formal and informal institutionalisation and interaction of multiple actors, both public and private (M. Smith 2004b; Webber et al. 2004; NorheimMartinsen 2010; Mérand et al. 2011), we expect that interest groups adopt multi-level strategies targeting policymakers both at the EU and national levels (see Joachim & Dembinski 2011).
H4 (multi-level vs. national level strategies): Groups tend to adopt strategies targeting actors at both EU and member state level, even when policymaking is
90

closer to the intergovernmental method.
An opposite account argues that the two-level games logic is still prevalent in those areas where intergovernmental arrangements are strong (CFSP/CSDP), therefore, there is little or no lobbying at the EU level. If this is so, we will see no confirmation of this hypothesis.
3.2. Case selection
The hypotheses outlined above are tested through a comparative analysis of three case studies, which are selected on the basis of a number of criteria. First, they represent a variation on the key explanatory variable – the policy regime, and thus range from the Community method to the intergovernmental method. I apply Mill’s (1875) “method of difference” (Leuffen 2007: 149) by looking for “comparable cases” in Lijphart’s (1975) terminology (Blatter & Haverland 2012: 42). Thus I intend to have other variables potentially explaining lobbying and influence of similar value, and either kept constant or controlled. Second, while focusing on the same time period, I opt for cases with a longer timeframe in order to take into account a more dynamic characteristic of alliance building. Finally, cases should cover a whole policy cycle (agenda setting, policy formulation and decision-making, implementation and evaluation). This will allow us to look at influence as a “continuous” rather than “dichotomous” variable, following the suggestion of Baumgartner & Leech (1998: 138) and not to miss interest group influence by focusing on a particular stage of the policymaking process. Moreover, given that few studies on the participation of non-state actors in EU foreign policy are available, we cannot really know where (at which stage of the policy cycle) to look for their influence.
Geographically, all the cases concern countries situated in the EU neighbourhood. The 91

EU’s neighbourhood has been named a top priority in terms of EU’s relations with the world, along with building of external relations architecture and strategic partnerships (Ashton 2010). This also implies that neighbouring countries are of similar importance for EU foreign policy and there is also a web of relations between the EU and its neighbourhood at various levels (supranational, state, sub-state) that includes both state and non-state actors. Ideally, it would be good to look at the same country, but it is difficult to find such a case in the real world with all criteria being fulfilled.
In this study, policy dossiers do not represent the most lobbied cases or issues in EU foreign policy, the approach which has been adopted in the previous study (Voltolini 2013). The preference is for cases which represent sub-policy areas that are typical of EU relations with the neighbourhood and in which the EU applies a standard set of foreign policy tools. At the same time, I opt for cases which have been in the spotlight of EU policy towards the regions and countries, thus they are likely to attract attention of interest groups.
A detailed overview of the selected cases is presented in Table 2. The case closest to the Community method concerns EU visa policy, with all supranational institutions involved and QMV in the Council, though the member states are responsible for implementation. The focus is on the EU’s eastern neighbours given that visa facilitation and liberalisation have been key objectives of the Eastern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the EU’s Eastern Partnership (EaP) initiative and as a means to promote security and reforms at the EU borders. The second case is closer to the intergovernmental extreme and centres on CSFP sanctions, with the Commission’s involvement in implementation and the EUCJ’s jurisdiction, if the Union measures are envisaged. While the EU has applied CSFP sanctions to many countries in its
92

neighbourhood (Belarus, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Moldova, Syria, Tunisia, Ukraine) as a response to a sudden degradation of governance and human rights standards or as a part of conflict management strategy, the case of Belarus is chosen given it has the longest history of EU sanctions policy towards this country. The third, ‘the hardest case’ from which supranational institutions are excluded represents the CSDP. The EU has deployed CSDP missions in the conflict-affected neighbouring countries of Georgia, Lybia, Palestinian territories and Ukraine, all of which are civilian. The case turns to the CSDP missions in Palestine and Georgia as the oldest ongoing missions in the neighbourhood. According to the hypothesis H1, we expect that interest groups are more likely to achieve the highest degrees of influence in the first case, lower degrees in the second and the lowest degrees in the third case.
The cases relate to the time period between 2004/2015 and 2014/2015. Such a decadelong time frame should enable us to examine advocacy and eventual group influence on policy change from a longitudinal perspective, which is rather rare in interest groups studies in the EU. According to the literature on advocacy coalitions, a time perspective of a decade or more is necessary in order to understand the process of policy change to check against external factors such as socio-economic and technological changes, changes in governing coalitions, as well as decisions and impacts from other policy sectors that affect a policy under question that vary substantially over the course of a few years or a decade (Sabatier 1988).
Within the studied period, there have been treaty reforms which have amended the institutional design of EU foreign policy. In particular, new foreign policy institutions have been created by the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009. It is assumed that these institutions have affected institutional set-ups in all cases in a sim-
93

ilar way. There were also a number of legal changes to the decision-making powers of the supranational institutions in all the selected cases. However, I maintain that they have not affected the type of policy regime in place.

While examining the relationship between institutional conditions and interest group influence, we have to take into account other determinants of influence. The issue characteristics such the scope and salience of the issue, the level of conflict, the newness, the presence of focusing event are seen as having impact upon the probability of achieving lobbying success (Mahoney 2008; Kluver 2013). It is assumed that all three foreign policy dossiers chosen for this study are similar in scope: they are high politics issues which concern EU values such as democracy, peace, security and economic freedoms and constitute relations with important for EU countries in the neighbourhood. They are expected to attract different kinds of interests. The degree of salience of the issues which refers to visibility or importance of the issue to the public (Mahoney 2008; Kollman 1998) is assumed to be similar and relatively constant. In general, foreign policy issues are considered to be low salience issues compared to domestic policies. New issues are more difficult to lobby on (Mahoney 2008; Joachim & Dembinski 2011). The selected foreign policy issues are well established rather than new, in the sense that they are part of portfolios of the existing structures at the EU level or conform with well-developed EU policies. The time frame and the degree to which violence may be involved in pursuing the policy is assumed to define to what extent multi-level governance extends to CFSP decision-making (M. Smith 2004b). This largely coincides with what Mahoney (2008) calls a focusing event – “a crisis or disaster” that affects the probability of lobbying success. It is hypothesised that these two characteristics may have impact on interest groups ability to participate in the policymaking process.
96

The time frame is defined as “a degree of urgency surrounding the issue: crises must be decided within weeks at most (more often days or even hours); short-term/medium-term policies may be decided over months or a few years; long-term problems must be decided over several years or even decades” (M. Smith 2004b). Given the time shortage, interest groups can hardly be involved in policymaking on urgency issues. CFSP sanctions and CSDP missions are often deployed as a reaction to crises or armed conflict in a third country or region. This contrasts with visa liberalisation which may seen as a more gradual policy development not enacted as an urgent response to an external crisis. Indeed, in the case of Belarus, first sanctions were introduced as a reaction to crisis, but then they were revised in a short/medium term perspective, and given EU sanctions towards Belarus have not been fully lifted since their introduction in 2004, we could argue that they have become a long-term solution. So we will be able to control for the time-frame factor examining several time periods. In the case of Georgia, the CSDP mission EUMM was deployed to monitor the ceasefire in the Russia-Georgia war of 2008. But we will be able to control for this factor having EUPOL COPPS in Palestine which was considered at least a year in advance.
Finally, in the case of CDSP missions, there is a possibility of violence, given that they are situated within conflict zones, though these missions are far from being combat military operations. Thus, we assume that this variation is not significant to explain the degree of interest group influence in comparison with the institutional set-up.
However, there are some issue-level characteristics that are not known in advance (for example, the degree of conflict on the issue). Moreover, group-level characteristics (e.g. financial resources, membership resources, information on constituencies interests, expertise) will vary too given that I do not have theoretical reasons not to expect both
97

resource-rich and resource-poor groups involved in lobbying. Thus I also employ within-case analysis to trace possible causal links and configurations of the many factors that impact on lobbying strategies and influence. Nevertheless, it is still expected that overall interest group influence will vary across three institutional contexts for all types of groups, even though resource-rich groups may be indeed more able to adapt to less favourable environments than resource-poor groups.
The combination of the cross-case and within-case analyses complement each other (Blatter & Haverland 2012: 212). Through the cross-case analysis I aim to answer the question of whether institutional design matters when seeking influence. Whereas within-case analysis allows us to understand the effect of the institutional design on lobbying and influence. This method is also needed to answer the underlying research question of how and to what extent interest groups influence EU foreign policy, or, in other words, what the consequences are of (intergovernmental) policymaking on the lobbying and influence of interest groups.
3.3. Operationalisation and data collection
Influence is conceptualised here as control over a policy outcome (Dür & De Bièvre 2007b: 3). What specifically constitutes a policy outcome differs across the policy cycle. At the agenda-setting stage it means an issue that groups have been promoting is raised to the EU agenda (or is kept out of it if this was the intended goal). At the policy formulation and decision-making stage, it implies that adopted policy or decision reflects a desired outcome which interest group lobbying has intended to achieve. At the implementation stage, an actual implementation of policy again reflects a desired outcome, whereas if groups are involved in evaluation, control over a policy outcome would imply that their inputs were reflected in the policy evaluation exercise which

RESEARCH
Small State Foreign Policy: The Diplomatic Recognition
of Taiwan
HU Shaohua
Despite the post-World War II emergence of many small states and growing economic interdependence, small state foreign policy still gets short shrift in international studies. This article seeks to enhance our understanding of the subject by examining the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. At the time of writing, 23 countries in the world have picked Taiwan over China. This is puzzling at first sight, since China is much more powerful than Taiwan, and a vast majority of countries pick China over Taiwan. This article shows that a full understanding must simultaneously take into account the systemic, domestic and individual levels of analysis. This research lends itself to structural realism, which stresses the role of structural factors in foreign policies, especially among small states. On the domestic level of analysis, this study identifies three important factors: ideology, economy and geography. For structural and cultural reasons, major leaders of Taiwan’s diplomatic allies are found to have loomed large in
the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.

recognition of Taiwan.2 The study of small state foreign policy will benefit from this case study of Taiwan, because all of Taiwan’s 23 allies are small states in different parts of the world and distinguish themselves from the vast majority of the countries by recognising Taiwan.3 Karl Deutsch defines a small state as one that accounts for less than one per cent of the world’s gross national product.4 The Dominican Republic, the largest economy among Taiwan’s allies, is less than 0.12 per cent of the world’s total. Using country size as a criterion can be arbitrary, but there is no denying that Taiwan’s allies are indeed small. Paraguay, its largest ally, ranks 60th in the world and accounts for 0.27 per cent of the world’s total land area. Population is the most commonly used criterion. David Vital classifies small states into two groups: developed countries with a population of 10 million to 15 million, or underdeveloped countries with a population of 20 million to 30 million.5 Burkina Faso, the most populous ally, has a population of less than 17 million. There is no doubt that Taiwan is democratic and prosperous, but China is far more powerful and influential, given its large population, huge territory, growing economy and military power. At the time of writing, 171 countries, including all global and regional powers, have chosen to recognise China over Taiwan. A question arises: why do those 23 small countries act differently?
Based on discrete and available information and research, this article employs the three levels of analysis to attempt at a comprehensive and systematic analysis.6 This approach may not be notable for intellectual sophistication and scientific rigour,7 but serves as a useful framework that helps us analyse the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The ideal scenario is to rely on one factor to explain the diplomatic recognition, but in reality there are multiple causes for any foreign policy. Also, to

The countries that maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan include four in Africa (Burkina Faso, Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe, and Swaziland); six in Oceania (Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu), six in Central America (Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama); five in the Caribbean (the Dominican Republic, Haiti, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines).

systematically collect information on all 23 countries is a daunting task for any scholar, especially in conducting analysis of small state foreign policy, since reliable information is even harder to come by. Taiwan’s allies are scattered around the world and studying them as a group can be challenging because those countries are beyond the purview of area specialists. Not the least of all, small states’ diplomatic moves may be reported by news media, but rarely become a subject of academic inquiry.
According to the three levels of analysis, international phenomena can be explained by factors and actors at the systemic, domestic and individual levels. The systemic level of analysis focuses on the role of the international system, including the relative position of relevant states in the world and their interactions. The domestic level of analysis takes into account the important factors within those states. This article elaborates on the role of ideology, economy and geography in the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The individual level of analysis discusses the importance of major decision-makers within those countries. The article proceeds in this sequence of presentation.
INTERNATIONAL CONSTRAINTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
The systematic level is the most comprehensive of the three levels of analysis. Causes at this level may be structural, which relate to the relative positions of states, or

procedural, which pertain to interactions among states. Structural realism, the dominant school of thought in international studies, highlights the primacy of the international system in foreign policy.8 Experts on small state foreign policy tend to espouse this view. Robert L. Rothstein, for example, maintains that the international system limits the freedom of small countries but also presents them with opportunities. For Michel Handel, the international system represents the more relevant level of analysis in the study of small state foreign policy. Susan A. Gitelson’s study of African countries shows that external causes, especially bilateral relations and regional factors, were more important than domestic ones in their decisions of breaking diplomatic relations with other countries. So far as Taiwan’s allies are concerned, two existing studies confirm the major influence of the international system on foreign policy-making. Peter M. Sanchez’s article on Panama concludes that the international system sets the parameters for the state and individuals, while Frank O. Mora’s study on Paraguay suggests that the strong systemic influence is due to its smallness and landlocked position.9
Generally speaking, the impact of the existing international system on foreign policy can be summarised in three ways. The structure discourages and even prohibits certain kinds of behaviour; determines what needs to be done and what can be done in foreign policy; and provides opportunities for individual countries. So far as the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan is concerned, three factors at the systemic level are at work.10 The first factor is that the Sino-American confrontation and rapprochement have heavily influenced the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. Taiwan’s international status originated from the Chinese civil war, which ended in a communist victory and the National government’s move to Taiwan, but the Cold War system consolidated the separation. The global competition between two superpowers and intense ideological conflicts turned the world into a zero-sum game. The outbreak of the Korean War motivated Washington to protect Taiwan, and the Chinese participation in the war turned China into an implacable enemy of the United States for two decades. The predominance of American military and economic power left many countries little choice but to follow Washington’s recognition of Taipei as the legitimate government of China. In addition, regional powers also influenced the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. For example, newly independent Swaziland immediately recognised Taipei because of its economic dependence on South Africa, its dominant anti-communist

neighbour.11 In Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia are under the influence of Australia and New Zealand; except Australia-influenced Kiribati and Nauru, Micronesia is mainly under American influence. After its recognition of Beijing in 1972, Australia encouraged newly independent Pacific states to do the same. As late as 1999, the former colonial ruler and a leading donor helped reverse the decision made by Papua New Guinea (PNG) to exchange diplomatic recognition for economic assistance from Taiwan.12 Washington dominated the western hemisphere. George T. Yu points out that, along with Catholicism, the American influence gave Taiwan an advantage in Latin America.13 In 1972, four Caribbean countries jointly established relations with Cuba so as to soften Washington’s wrath. Seven of the 12 Caribbean countries recognised China, most of them following the American example. Only five countries had relations with Cuba and three with the Soviet Union.14 Regional factors do not go unnoticed by diplomats. A Chinese diplomat recalled that Panama’s diplomatic ties with Taiwan were subject to American special influence and subtle control, and that the overthrow of Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega scuttled his plan to switch recognition from Taipei to Beijing. A Guatemalan diplomat from the permanent mission to the United Nations listed Taipei’s close ties to Central America as a reason for the Guatemalan recognition of Taiwan.15
Among Taiwan’s 23 current allies, Panama and the Vatican City recognised the Republic of China (ROC) in 1911 and 1942, respectively, well before the People’s Republic of China (PRC) was established. For all others, the Sino-American confrontation left them with very limited choices in the 1950s and 1960s. Before US President Richard Nixon’s visit to China in 1972, seven countries recognised Taiwan: Haiti in 1956, the Dominican Republic and Paraguay in 1957, Guatemala in 1960, El Salvador in 1961, Honduras in 1965 and Swaziland in 1968. The normalisation of Sino-American relations in the 1970s had removed the systematic constraints on the diplomatic recognition of China and undermined Taipei’s international status. Between 1963 and mid 1975, the number of Taiwan’s allies dropped from 66 to 26, while those that recognised Beijing increased from 50 to 112.16 Among Taiwan’s current allies, five won independence and then recognised Taipei after Nixon’s visit

and before the end of the Cold War in 1989: Tuvalu in 1979, St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 1981, St. Kitts and Nevis and the Solomon Islands in 1983, and Belize in 1989. For these countries, the recognition of Taiwan was a matter of choice. Mainly for economic reasons, as shall be discussed later in the section, nine countries except Palau switched recognition from China to Taiwan after the end of the Cold War.
The second factor that influences the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan is the political and economic status of small states in the post-WWII era. All of Taiwan’s allies but Vatican City experienced colonialism.17 Like many developing countries, Taiwan’s allies won political independence, but remained economically dependent. Independence serves postcolonial societies well as a result of the Westphalian principle of sovereignty.18 Christopher Clapham views the regime as “almost entirely beneficial” for developing countries. According to Jeanne A. K. Hey, small states enjoy unpre­ cedented visibility and prestige as well as physical security and legal equality, and are no longer pawns in the post-Cold War era.19 In the UN General Assembly, all members have the same voting power and small states have even been elected to high office. By the late 1990s, for example, Belize, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines held the vice presidency.20 Notwithstanding their political independence, many developing countries depend on great powers in economic realms.21 Unlike the “bargaining model”, which attributes compliance from weak states to strong states’ use of punishments and rewards, the “dependency model” views the link between economic dependence and foreign policy as a long-term structural relationship.22 In most African countries, the search for outside resources was said to be central to

17  Sao Tome was a Portuguese colony; Burkina Faso and Haiti were French colonies; the Dominican Republic, Paraguay and all Central American countries except Belize were Spanish colonies. Under the British rule were Gambia and Swaziland in Africa; Kiribati, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu in the Pacific; and Belize, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. The Marshall Islands and Palau were UN trust territories, administered by the United States. Nauru was a League of Nations mandate and then a UN trust territory. 18  For sovereignty, see Robert Jackson, “Sovereignty in World Politics: A Glance at the Conceptual and Historical Landscape”, Political Studies 47, no. 3 (1999): 431–56; and Christopher Clapham, “Sovereignty and the Third World State”, Political Studies 47, no. 3 (1999): 522–37. 19  Clapham, “Sovereignty and the Third World State”, p. 531; and Hey, “Introducing Small State Foreign Policy,” in Small States in World Politics, ed.

their foreign policies.23 The small states in Oceania have little choice but to rely on the Western powers for their stability, development and security, according to MacDonald.24 Except Nauru and Fiji, aid had accounted for more than one-third of the national income in all other countries. For about half of the group, the comparable figures were more than two-thirds.25 Foreign aid to Pacific island countries on a per capita basis has also been the highest in the world.26 Many developing countries have been creative in selling sovereignty for economic benefits. Each Tuvalu citizen received roughly US$400 annually over a decade for selling internet domain name “.tv” to an American firm.27 Nauru became the fourth country to recognise Abkhazia, a Russian protectorate in Caucasus, allegedly requesting US$50 million in return for its diplomatic action.28 After Palau agreed to accept up to 17 Chinese Muslim detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Washington decided to provide US$200 million develop­ ment aid but denied it as a quid pro quo for the detainee deal.29 Despite its rather early independence, Central America still depended on foreign markets, investments and aid. Take Nicaragua, the largest country in the region, for instance. By the end of 1989, 81.5 per cent of its needs were met by foreign aid. In 1981, 65.1 per cent of such aid came from capitalist countries; and by 1985, 90.3 per cent of foreign aid was from communist countries. From 1990 to 1995, aid in per capita terms was US$1,000 and one-third was used to pay debts.30 Caribbean economies are dependent on American and European economies, and often suffer from trade deficit and heavy debt. From traditional reliance on the export of sugar and banana to the contemporary shift to tourism and service industries, they have been very vulnerable to external shocks.31
Furthermore, two factors in the post-Cold War system also affected the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. While developing countries received less foreign assistance from great powers, the cross-strait competition had presented small states with opportunities. After the end of the Cold War, Russia lacked interest in and capabilities of offering help. Having enjoyed the peace dividend, Washington later redirected resources towards

the war on terror and two wars in the Middle East. The formation and expansion of the European Union entailed more money on newer member states. Even the globalisation process did not benefit many developing countries. Caribbean economies, for instance, not only lost some trade privileges in Europe, but also suffered in trade and investment from the competition of the North American Free Trade Agreement.32 Around the end of the Cold War, Lee Teng-hui assumed the presidency in 1988, starting to push for more international space for Taiwan.33 Taipei ditched the Hallstein Doctrine, which prohibits dual recognition of a divided nation, and used its economic resources to gain international recognition. By June 1989, eight more countries recognised Taiwan.
The eagerness for diplomatic recognition is rooted in the international status of Taiwan. The Montevideo Convention defines four criteria of statehood: a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other states and declare the political existence of the state to be independent of international recognition. As Taiwan has satisfied the first three criteria, it has sought diplomatic recognition to strengthen its claim as a sovereign state. On the other side of the strait, Beijing did not sit idly by. A bidding war thus intensified between Taiwan and China, to the benefit of some small states.34 The Central African Republic and Senegal have switched back and forth between Taipei and Beijing five times since 1962. Pro-independence president Chen Shui-bian continued to practise “checkbook diplomacy” but the number of Taiwan’s allies dropped from 29 to 23 during his eight-year tenure. Nine of the current allies recognised Taiwan after the end of the Cold War. Except Palau, whose recognition in 1999 came after its independence, all other countries switched their recognition from Beijing to Taipei mainly for economic

reasons. Three countries recognised Beijing first and then made the switch: Sao Tome in 1997, the Marshall Islands in 1998 and Kiribati in 2003. Five countries had switched from Taipei to Beijing and then switched back to Taipei. The Sandinista government in Nicaragua embraced Beijing in 1985 but the democratically elected government recognised Taipei in 1990. Burkina Faso maintained diplomatic ties with Taiwan from 1961 to 1973, and after maintaining relations with Beijing for more than two decades, switched back to Taipei in 1994. Gambia recognised Taipei from 1968 to 1974, and switched back to Taipei in 1995. Nauru had recognised Taipei since 1980, and after a three-year gap, restored relations with Taipei in 2005. St. Lucia recognised Taiwan from 1984 to 1997, and a decade later, switched back from Beijing to Taipei in 2007. To lessen the budgetary burden, avoid diplomatic scandals and improve cross-strait relations, Taiwan president Ma Ying-jeou opted for “diplomatic truce”. In seeking the status quo and avoiding purchasing diplomatic recognition, this policy has been well received in Beijing.35 Taipei has so far not gained or lost any diplomatic allies.
DOMESTIC SOURCES OF DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION
Great thinkers of different political stripes recognise the importance of the domestic sources of foreign policy. Immanuel Kant rationalises that a democratic political system will facilitate perpetual peace, while Lenin stresses the impact of the domestic economic conditions of a given country on its foreign policy. Scholars in international studies have elaborated on the importance of domestic sources. For example, Hans J. Morgenthau offers a thoughtful and comprehensive analysis on this; Ray Cline highlights the differences between tangible and intangible elements of power; and James N. Rosenau focuses on the size, the level of development and the political system of any given state.36 With regard to the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan, two important factors in foreign policy are not discussed here. One is military power, because all of Taiwan’s allies do not possess such capabilities or even face security threats. The other factor is regime type, since it seems illogical to use the diverse regime types of Taiwan’s allies to account for their common diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.37 In addition, domestic

Now, the Vatican City is ecclesiastic, while Swaziland is monarchial. Burkina Faso and Gambia adopt the presidential system, but their current leaders are former coup leaders. Generally speaking, presidential systems are found in Sao Tome; in Kiribati, Nauru, Palau and the Marshall Islands; in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Paraguay and Central American allies. Parliamentary systems are adopted in the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu; Belize and the three Eastern Caribbean countries.

actors such as bureaucrats and interest groups will be discussed at the individual level of analysis. This section will elaborate on three factors: ideational, economic and geographical.
Ideational Factors
Ideational factors, such as ideology, norms, identities and culture, play a part in foreign policy.38 There are different assessments of their role in the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. On the one hand, their importance is discounted. Timothy S. Rich’s study on the recognition of Taiwan from 1960 to 2007 shows the importance of exports, distance from Beijing, and the Cold War years but the insignificance of area size and the level of democracy. None of the diplomats who were interviewed by Czeslaw Tubilewicz and Alain Guilloux in Taipei had attached importance to political values in their countries’ policy towards Taiwan.39 Importantly, no one fails to notice that all major democratic countries in the world in fact recognise Beijing. Economic interests often trump ideological preference. In Africa, two coup leaders switched diplomatic recognition to Taiwan. Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso overthrew a Marxist regime, but was the first foreign leader to visit China after the Tiananmen tragedy. His switch from Beijing to Taipei was a result of more monetary than ideological considerations.40 Not long after ending Africa’s longest democracy, Gambia’s coup leader recognised Taiwan in 1995. Central America also provided illuminating examples. Leftist Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua intended to recognise Beijing during the 2006 presidential campaign, but did not do so after his election. Taiwan had not only invested around US$127 million during his predecessor’s term, but also donated US$30 million for the construction of a power plant and provided US$1.1 million to an anti-hunger project initiated by his wife.41 Costa Rica has the strongest democracy in the region and had diplomatic relations with the ROC for more than six decades, but was also the first and only country to abandon Taipei, following the decision from President Oscar Arias, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, in 2007 to break off ties. A major contributing factor is that Beijing agreed to buy US$300 million in bonds and give Costa Rica US$130 million in aid.42

Modern history, on the other hand, suggests that the role of ideational factors in foreign policy cannot be ruled out. As early as 1907, five Central American countries agreed to use non-recognition to discourage coups or revolutions. In the western hemisphere, communism was anathema to right-wing military regimes and Catholicism. Only Cuba and Chile recognised China before Beijing entered the UN. Paraguay is another case that clearly stands out. During the rule of Paraguayan military strongman Alfredo Stroessner, the non-aligned Yugoslavia was the only communist country that set up an embassy there. Anti-communism and democratic values remained at work even after China pushed forward its reform and opening-up. Prime Minister Solomon Mamaloni of the Solomon Islands explained that his country only established relations with democracies.43 According to Palau President Kuniwo Nakamura, Taiwan is a democratic island nation, shares similar cultures to Palau, and had the potential of becoming a strong economic partner, whereas China is a communist country that might populate the island with many Chinese.44 The Tiananmen tragedy led to Grenada’s and Belize’s recognition of Taiwan in the second half of 1989. Larus’s article in 2008 aptly points out that most of Taiwan’s allies are democracies and that many have stressed the importance of democratic ideology.45 Along with ideology, colonial experiences and national identity as a small state have predisposed Taiwan’s allies to sympathise with Taiwan. Some people in Oceanian countries have felt ill at ease in dealing with China, which to them lacks democracy, has records of human rights abuse, and uses its sheer size to seek recognition.46 Small states are sensitive to great powers’ words and deeds. “You gringos have pushed us around for 150 years, and we never liked it,” said the foreign minister of one Central American country. “So what makes the Chinese think that kind of Great Power arrogance would be any more palatable coming from them? For them to tell us not to recognize Taiwan is no different than Washington saying we shouldn’t have relations with Cuba.”47
Economic Factors
A comparative study of diplomatic recognition in three divided nations (West Germany, Taiwan and South Korea) demonstrates the limitation of power and ideology and the importance of economic aid.48 The fact that all of Taiwan’s allies except the Vatican

City are developing countries raises the question of if and how economic factors may influence diplomatic recognition. Three specific economic factors are examined, namely trade and tourism, investments and aid. Trade is of little account in the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan because Taiwan’s allies, being located far away from Taiwan, do not have much to export to Taiwan. Tourism should be important to many of Taiwan’s allies but their geographical remoteness and smallness have limited the number of Taiwanese tourists. In July 2011, for instance, youth ambassadors from Taipei had to make four transit stops to reach the College of the Marshall Islands for cultural exchange.49 According to the World Factbook by Central Intelligence Agency, Taiwan is not among the top trading partners with any of its allies in imports or exports. By contrast, China is the largest export destination for Burkina Faso, Gambia and the Solomon Islands, and also among the top trading partners of 11 of Taiwan’s allies in terms of imports.50 An obvious example is Panama, which was Taiwan’s largest trading partner in Central America and the first country to conclude a free trade pact with Taiwan in 2004. As Taiwan’s 66th largest trading partner in 2003, Panama suffered a deficit, with US$4.8 million in exports and US$123 million in imports.51 For the same geographical and economic factors, most of Taiwan’s allies have little to export to or invest in China.
Taipei did encourage its citizens to invest in its allies, which are in need of foreign investment. Taiwan has invested over US$90 million in Swaziland over the years,52 building a textile factory and providing a grant to upgrade highway access to Swaziland’s two neighbours, among others. By virtue of its geographic proximity, Palau attracted substantial investors and tourists from Taiwan.53 Many regional free trade agreements have also helped drawn Taiwanese investment in Central America. “Taiwan-El Salvador Park” developed agriculture and food processing industries. In Nicaragua, Taiwan has substantial investments in the textile industry and the “Free Zone” industrial park, and majority ownership of the Inter-Continental Hotel. Panama has also received large private-sector investment from Taiwan. The largest among more than 50 companies that invest in Panama is the Evergreen Group, the world’s biggest container shipping company. It has invested in many projects, including a container port, an industrial park and an airline. Several Taiwanese companies established plants in the new industrial park. Other projects that were launched include a cruise ship port, a shipping facility on the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, an ecotourism

facility and a transportation hub.54 Despite Taipei’s efforts to promote investment in Panama, private investors have been discouraged by many factors, such as poor infrastructure, weak industrial base and lack of skilled labour.
Foreign aid is the most important economic factor for the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.55 Taiwan began to provide technical assistance to allies in 1959, and has increased its provision of grants, relief and loans since 1988. Taipei aimed to offer US$10 million annually to a smaller ally and US$20 million to a larger ally. Taipei’s aid to its allies is distinguished by simple and clear objective to serve donor interests and to meet recipient needs. Taipei aims to maintain diplomatic relations, hence its offer in aid has no or few strings attached, while its allies seek external resources to meet domestic shortfalls. Before the end of the Cold War, Africa had the world’s lowest rate of private foreign investment and the highest rate of public foreign aid. In 1986, foreign aid accounted for 28 per cent of the combined gross domestic product of seven sub-Saharan countries, including Burkina Faso and Gambia, and 41 per cent of Sao Tome’s GDP relied on foreign aid.56 Taiwanese aid to Gambia had surpassed US$100 million.57 In Oceania, Taiwan’s budgetary grants to the Marshall Islands between 2005 and 2008 were so large that the aid averaged about US$600 per capita, almost one-quarter of the Marshall Islands’ per capita income in 2008.58 Taiwan was the only country that provided financial aid to the Solomon Islands during the 1999–2003 civil unrest.59 By recognising Taiwan in 1989 and 1990, the Bahamas, Grenada, Belize and Nicaragua received US$2.5 million, US$10 million, US$50 million and US$100 million, respectively, in aid.60 Taipei provided Nicaragua with US$60 million and US$30 million in loans in 1991 and in 1992, respectively;61 as well as set up a US$250 million investment fund to promote technology and export in the Dominican Republic. Taiwan is the largest aid donor to many Caribbean countries, providing

most of the relief efforts to countries ravaged by natural disasters. In sum, trade and tourism, investments, and aid are three economic factors that, in ascending order of importance, contribute to the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.
Geographical Factors
Two key geographical attributes of Taiwan’s allies—their significant distance from Taiwan and China and small country size—are major factors contributing to their diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. It is axiomatic that distance decreases power.62 Although China possesses intercontinental missiles and an ocean-going navy, it has little reason to threaten or use force against Taiwan’s allies. China’s status as a permanent member of the UN Security Council seldom changed the minds of Taiwan’s allies. In the late 1990s, Beijing threatened to veto the extension of the UN peace mission in Haiti, and in fact vetoed the UN resolution of sending a military mission to Guatemala for the first time in 24 years, but later made a compromise. When Nauru and Tuvalu applied to join the UN around the turn of the century, all Beijing did was to delay their application.63 The distance factor hence minimises Chinese power over them, as all of Taiwan’s allies are far away from China.
Another fact is no less important—almost all of Taiwan’s allies are small in population and area, and most lack natural resources and are prone to natural disasters.64 Only Burkina Faso and Guatemala—Taiwan’s two largest allies—have a population larger than 10 million; nine allies have a population of between one and 10 million; and 11 allies have a population of less than one million, 10 of which have population less than 200,000. Three of Taiwan’s largest allies are Paraguay, Burkina Faso and Nicaragua in terms of land area and are placed 60th, 75th and 98th largest in the world, respectively. Burkina Faso is landlocked; Gambia, the smallest country in continental Africa, is surrounded by Senegal. As Africa’s smallest country, Sao Tome has not benefited from newly discovered oil reserves in the Gulf of Guinea.65 Swaziland is almost entirely surrounded by South Africa, and has the world’s highest HIV/AIDS

62 For discussions on the impact of distance on foreign policy, see, for example, Alan K. Henrikson, “Distance and Foreign Policy: A Political Geography Approach”, International Political Science Review 23, no. 4 (October 2002): 437–66; and Eric Neumayer, “Distance, Power and Ideology: Diplomatic Representation in a Spatial, Unequal and Divided World”, Area 40, no. 2 (2008): 228–36. 63 John Henderson and Benjamin Reilly, “Dragon in Paradise: China’s Rising Star in Oceania”, The National Interest (Summer 2003): 102. 64  According to the World Risk Report 2011, Taiwan’s allies are prone to natural disasters. Data for eight allies, all of those from Oceania and the Caribbean except the Vatican City, is not available. In the remaining 15 countries, seven (the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Gambia, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and the Solomon Islands) are categorised as very high level in the exposure index; three countries (Burkina Faso, Haiti, and Panama) are categorised as high; two (Belize and Swaziland) are categorised as medium; and three (Kiribati, Paraguay and Sao Tome) as very low.

prevalence rate. Taiwan’s allies in Oceania may seem to be in paradise, but they, with the exception of the Solomon Islands, are small in area and poor in resources. The world’s smallest republic, Nauru, faces survival difficulty because of phosphate depletion as a result of mining and also its dependence on import for almost everything. In addition, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu are threatened by rising sea levels. Tuvalu, with an area of 26 square kilometres, may become the world’s first country to be swallowed by the ocean.66 Kiribati’s president told Taiwan President Ma that his countrymen might have to evacuate to Taiwan some day.67 Caribbean small states are characterised by their narrow resource bases and high population density, and have to endure increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes.68 In Central America, the population soared from about five million in 1930 to over 36 million by 2002. The mountainous terrain of the region has hindered economic development, and the region is also prone to earthquakes and hurricanes. The most remote ally of Taiwan, Paraguay is landlocked and lives in the shadow of its two major neighbours, namely Brazil and Argentina. Overall, all of Taiwan’s allies but five Central American countries fall into one or two of the three categories of countries that need special attention from the UN (i.e., the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small-island developing states). Owing to the small country size of its allies, Taiwan encountered very few problems in exchanging economic benefits for diplomatic recognition. In reality, Taiwan is one of the world’s top holders of foreign exchange reserves. According to President Ma, Taiwan’s US$390 million in international assistance in 2010 accounted for only 0.1 per cent of its GDP, below 0.28 per cent on average among advanced countries and far below the 0.7 per cent target set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.69 Citing the few number of allies that Taiwan has, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias Sanchez bluntly criticised Taipei as stingy.70
To recapitulate, three major domestic factors are integral to the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. Ideational factors were relatively important during the Cold War although their influence has declined but endured. Economic and geographical factors, on the other hand, will go a long way in explaining diplomatic recognition. Almost all of Taiwan’s allies are developing countries in need of favourable international economic relations. Given their small country size and long distance from Taiwan and

China, trade, tourism and investments play second fiddle to direct economic assistance. While affluent Taiwan is both willing and able to help in economic aspect, the distance diminishes Chinese military and economic influences on Taiwan’s allies.
THE ROLE OF MAJOR DECISION-MAKERS
Generally speaking, there are two major views on the importance of individuals in history, including foreign policy. Marxism tends to downplay the role of individuals.71 Plekhanov acknowledges the considerable influence that individuals can exert on society, but maintains that the extent of influence is determined by the internal structure of societies and international relations. Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of French King Louis XV, was blamed for France’s failure in the Seven Years’ War (1756–63), but Plekhanov argues that her influence was determined by France’s societal structure and that the French defeat was largely attributable to common causes, including an ill-disciplined military.72 Other scholars, however, highlight the important role of major national leaders.73 According to Byman and Pollack, individual leaders exercise influence over domestic and international factors, such as their countrys’ intentions, power and strategy, as well as other countries’ policy. Interestingly, the co-authors also used the Seven Years’ War to highlight the fact that the death of Czarina Elizabeth prompted the Russian withdrawal from the war and hence turned the tide against France and its allies.74
Existing studies of developing countries, including Taiwan’s allies, often point to the importance of leaders’ roles. According to Peter J. Schraeder, besides the international economic and political factors, authoritarian leaders had an overriding impact on the foreign policies of African states during the Cold War. Abdoulaye Saine’s research suggests that the Gambian executive branch dominated the foreign policy-making under the regimes of former President Jawara and current President Jammeh. According to Anthony P. Spanakos and Howard J. Wiarda, the contemporary foreign policy of the Dominican Republic can be best explained by the changes in leadership and

71  Marx maintains that “men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly found, given and transmitted from the past”. See Karl Marx, “The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte”, in The Marx-Engels Reader, 2nd ed., ed. Robert C. Tucker (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1978), p. 595. 72 George Plekhanov, The Role of the Individual in History (New York: International Publishers, 1940). 73  Karl Popper claims that “all social phenomena, and especially the functioning of all social institutions, should always be understood as resulting from the decisions, actions, attitudes, etc., of human individuals”. K. R. Popper, The Open Society and Its Enemies, vol. 2, 5th ed. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966), p. 98. 74  Daniel L. Byman and Kenneth M. Pollack, “Let Us Now Praise Great Men: Bringing the Statesman Back In”, International Security 25, no. 4 (2001): 107–46. The importance of leaders’ role is also highlighted by Margaret G. Hermann and Joe D. Hagan, “International Decision Making: Leadership Matters”, Foreign Policy 110 (Spring 1998): 124–37.

in the international system. Rosenau has ranked leaders’ role at the individual level higher than societal factors, and JoAnn Fagot Aviel’s study of Nicaragua finds that such ranking is valid for the Somoza period but not applicable for the period after the Sandinista revolution. Mora’s study of Paraguay also corroborates the importance of the individual level during and after Stroessner’s rule.75
The fact that several post-Cold War diplomatic switches happened in three different regions shed light on the role of individual leaders. From its independence in 1975 till its first democratic election in 1991, Sao Tome, led by President Manuel Pinto da Costa, forged close ties with communist countries, including China. Miguel Trovoada was the first prime minister after independence, but was later dismissed, detained and exiled. After he won the 1991 election, the country still suffered from the double whammy of political instability and heavy dependence on foreign aid. There were two failed coup attempts in 1995 and 2003 as people protested against price increases and overdue salaries. In exchange for US$30 million in aid, Trovoada switched to recognise Taipei in 1997.76 The decision upset the legislature for the lack of prior consultation, and the controversy led to the limitation of presidential power and distinct separation of powers in the constitution.77 President da Costa, having reclaimed the presidency in 2011, did not host Taiwan President Ma during his 2012 trip to the African allies.
Five of the Pacific island states have so far switched recognition between Taipei and Beijing, and two had done so in the first half of the 2000s.78 Nauru has undergone frequent changes of leadership. René Harris served as president four times between 1999 and 2004. Taipei’s influence in a local election and its indifference towards Nauru’s pending bankruptcy displeased him. He switched recognition to Beijing in 2002 after Taipei refused to quintuple its annual aid to Nauru and Beijing promised financial assistance instead. The decision was announced on the day when Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian was elected as chairman of the ruling party, and it was said that this move later led to his call for a referendum on Taiwan independence. Nauru did not gain much from Beijing even though Harris had lined his pockets with the funds.79 In 2005, Ludwig Scotty, who served as president twice immediately before and after Harris’s last tenure, restored diplomatic ties with Taipei following the agreement to finance the operation of Nauru’s only airline.

Kiribati switched diplomatic recognition from Beijing to Taipei after Anote Tong won the presidency in 2003. A son of a Chinese immigrant, he rose to power after President Teburoro Tito was deposed by the parliament. Tito had refused to disclose a lease deal related to Beijing’s satellite-tracking station in the country and had allegedly received donations from Beijing. One month after winning a third term, a vote of no confidence was passed against him. In the next election, Anote Tong narrowly defeated his elder brother Harry, who was supported by the former president. Anote Tong’s party raised suspicion of the Chinese facility built in 1997. Since it might be used to spy on the American missile test site in the Marshall Islands, two American fighter jets had buzzed it in 2002. Taipei reportedly gave Anote Tong’s party more than US$1 million, but he denied the allegation. Harry, on the other hand, admitted that he had made the promise to recognise Taiwan in exchange for cash from Taiwan if he was elected. President Tong embraced Taipei even against the wishes of Canberra, and his visit to Taipei in February 2004 had helped Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian win re-election.
St. Lucia’s diplomatic switch to Taipei in 2007 halted the much-feared domino effect in the Caribbean after Dominica’s switch to Beijing in 2004. This diplomatic move was made possible by John Compton, known as the “father of the country”, who founded the conservative United Workers’ Party, guided St. Lucia to independence and served as the prime minister on three occasions. Compton recognised Taipei in 1984 despite Beijing’s economic aid since its independence. The Labour Party later switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in 1997. Compton came out of his retirement and led his party to win the 2006 elections before his death in 2007. After the elections, he said, “Our foreign policy cannot change with every government. A foreign policy must look at the interest of the country ... A country has no friends— particularly small countries—you have to look at where your interests are.”80 During the decade when St. Lucia maintained ties with Beijing, a US$15 million cricket stadium was completed; a US$10 million mental hospital was under construction with Chinese funding; although a tourist influx did not materialise, some small Chinese shops set up businesses on the island. As Taipei promised to help St. Lucia develop the agriculture and livestock sector, boost tourism and create information technology learning centres,81 Compton decided to shift diplomatic gear in favour of Taipei.
The importance of leaders’ role in the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan is not surprising. Foreign policy in many countries emanates from the interplay of different sources, which form and can be viewed as a set of concentric circles. The outer circle represents societal sources. People in mature democracies may even lack an interest in

foreign policy.82 Foreign policies, in reality, attract less public attention and participation than domestic ones. Crisis issues that involve military force attract more attention than non-crisis issues like economic interactions. Moreover, their opinions are often shaped by elites and the press.83 According to the Almond-Lippmann consensus, public opinion should not be a major determinant in foreign policy-making, because it is volatile, lacks consistency and exerts negligible impact.84 Although most of Taiwan’s allies are democracies, they have strong authoritarian traditions and cultures that are not conducive to public participation. From the perspective of Taiwan’s allies, their decision to establish diplomatic ties with Taiwan is more of an economic-developmental issue rather than a political-diplomatic one. Consequently, most people are relatively uninterested in it. For example, even people in Palau, Taiwan’s closest ally geographically, lack interest in the Taiwan issue.85 Even overseas Chinese or Chinese citizens living in the countries of Taiwan’s Pacific allies also have little influence on foreign policy.86
The intermediate circle constitutes governmental sources. As alternatives to the rational actor model, which assumes that foreign policy is made by rational and unitary governments, Graham Allison proposes the organisational process model and the bureaucratic politics model.87 In organisational process, the fact that diplomacy is conducted in a secret manner provides top leaders greater leeway. Both Taipei and Beijing have attempted to keep their aid secretive in order to forestall a bidding game between themselves and among their allies. A diplomatic scandal in 2008 illustrates the clandestinity behind diplomacy. Several years ago, Taipei engaged two middlemen to seek diplomatic recognition from Papua New Guinea, but without success. In the end, the US$30 million slush fund could not be recovered. The lack of transparency leaves more room for leaders’ interests and predilection.88 For example, Palau President

Ngitratkel Etpison was invited by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to visit Taiwan shortly after the former’s trip to China in the early 1990s. The presidents of Palau and Taiwan, which were both former Japanese colonies, hit it off well as they conversed in Japanese and even toured Taipei on their own. Etpison promised to recognise Taipei after Palau gained independence.89 That said, the lack of transparency in negotiations on diplomatic recognition in fact reflects and encourages corrupt practices. If the “Corruption Perceptions Index” (CPI) is any indication, Taiwan was ranked 32nd and China 75th out of 183 countries worldwide in 2011, where No. 1 in ranking denotes the least corrupt state and a higher ranking number indicates higher levels of corruption. The CPI rankings of Taiwan’s allies are as follows: St. Lucia at 25, St. Vincent and the Grenadines at 36, Gambia at 77, El Salvador at 80, Panama at 86, Kiribati and Swaziland at 95, Burkina Faso and Sao Tome at 100, Guatemala and the Solomon Islands at 120, the Dominican Republic and Honduras at 129, Nicaragua at 134, Paraguay at 154 and Haiti at 175.90
The bureaucratic politics model does not seem to apply well to developing countries, including Taiwan’s allies. Max Weber identifies three types of authority: traditional, charismatic and legal-rational. But legal-rational authority is often lacking in developing countries. Henry A. Kissinger characterises many Third World leaders as the revolutionary-charismatic type, as opposed to the bureaucratic-pragmatic type and the ideological type, which are typical of leaders in the United States and communist countries, respectively.91 Bahgat Korany examines three approaches in the study of Third World foreign policy: economistic, bureaucratic-bargaining, and psychologicalperceptual, and argues that the dominance of the last approach is due to personalised political process in those countries.92 According to Vital, decision-makers in small states are less influenced by the bureaucracy.93 Maurice A. East’s study of Uganda ascribes the negligible influence of its ministry of foreign affairs to the lack of manpower.94 Small country size and the way institutional arrangements take shape, in BraveboyWagner’s view, have enabled leaders of Caribbean countries to play a key role in foreign policy.95
The inner circle is represented by major leaders and their advisers. National leaders may pick Taiwan over Beijing, thinking that they have acted in their national

interest. Anthony Van Fossen points out that when an economic or political crisis befalls pacific states, they are more likely to switch diplomatic recognition for more economic assistance, and sometimes decide against the switch when a higher counteroffer is made.96 Leaders may sometimes put their personal interests before national ones. In the Solomon Islands, its closer economic ties with China did not cause its leaders to switch diplomatic recognition to Beijing because domestic politics have prevailed over national economic interests, at least in the short term.97 According to Steven R. David, the most important determinant of Third World countries’ diplomatic alignment is the motivation of leaders to ensure their own political and physical survival, since the governments are weak and illegitimate and the stakes for domestic politics are very high.98 The problem is further aggravated by the prevalence of nepotism and cronyism. The influence of clans is a case in point. In Nicaragua, the Chamorro family had produced six presidents in the 19th and 20th centuries; and in Panama, Arnulfo Arias and later his widow Mireya Moscoso competed with Omar Torrijos and his son Martin Torrijos to dominate the political scene.
Examples of self-serving leaders abound among Taiwan’s allies. Liberian President Charles Taylor (1997–2003) admitted to receiving US$1 million from Taipei during his presidential elections. According to WikiLeaks, after Nauru established diplomatic relations with Taipei in 2005, Taipei paid Nauruan ministers and members of parliament a monthly stipend of US$5,000 and US$2,500, respectively.99 In addition, many of the corruption scandals in Central America were linked to Taiwan. In Costa Rica, a US$400,000 donation from Taiwan made between 2001 and 2002 was deposited into a bank account of a Panamanian company owned by President Miguel Angél Rodríguez (1998–2002). To support Rodríguez’s bid to become secretary general of the Organization of American States, a Taiwanese company loaned him US$1 million without specifying details for repayment. During Costa Rica’s 2002 presidential elections, Abel Pacheco’s campaign obtained illegal contributions amounting to US$500,000 from Taiwan, while the opposition party received US$300,000. Taiwan’s US$4.8 million donation for economic development projects was instead used to pay 34 employees of the Costa Rican foreign ministry. In Guatemala, President Alfonso Portillo (2000–4) reportedly received US$1.5 million from Taipei, one-third of which was earmarked for him personally four days before his presidency.100 He was later charged in New York with money laundering and embezzling US$1.5 million donated by Taiwan to buy schoolbooks for children. In Nicaragua, Taiwan paid for the construction of

a new presidential palace and foreign ministry building as well as the renovation of the National Assembly building. Between 2000 and 2001, a private foundation controlled by Nicaraguan President Arnold Alemán (1998–2002) deposited more than US$1.5 million from Taiwan into a Panamanian bank account. During Enrique Bolaños’ (2002–2007) presidential campaign, his party received US$4.9 million from Taiwan. In Panama, President Mireya Moscoso (1999–2004) allowed the private foundations created by her associates to administer Taiwan’s US$45 million donation. The first foreign leader to visit Taiwan President Chen, Moscoso allegedly received a cash gift of US$1 million from him on her birthday, but both denied the allegation.101
The important role of major leaders in foreign policy is widely accepted, but it is sometimes hard to prove due to the secretive manner in which foreign policy is conducted. Hopefully, the aforementioned cases from different parts of the world serve to help us appreciate the importance of major leaders in the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. Structural and cultural factors contribute to our understanding the role of major leaders. Within the outer societal circle of the concentric circles people are less interested in foreign policy than domestic ones. Within the intermediate governmental circle, the underdeveloped bureaucracy in small developing countries, in reality, gives leaders greater leverage in foreign policy. In the inner leadership circle, leaders have more incentives to dominate foreign policy, since foreign aid is important to their country and their own survival.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
This article employs the three levels of analysis to explain the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. It lends evidence and support to structural realism, which maintains that the factors at the systemic level tend to be most significant for small states. Whereas the Cold War system had made it virtually impossible for many small states to recognise China, the normalisation of Sino-American relations removed the systemic constraints and opened the possibility of more choices for small states. The sovereign status of small states guaranteed by the Westphalian system and their economic dependence on the outside world encourage and enable them to exchange diplomatic recognition of Taiwan for economic benefits. The post-Cold War system witnessed a decrease in aid from great powers on the one hand, and intense competition between Taipei and Beijing for diplomatic recognition on the other. These structural factors have set constraints on and/or provide opportunities for small countries in establishing diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
Domestic factors like military power and regime types do not have significant influence on small states’ decisions to establish diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Like many small states, Taiwan’s allies lack military power or do not face any security

threats. In addition, there is no logic relevance to analyse how the diverse political systems of Taiwan’s allies influences their decision to recognise Taiwan. Instead three factors—ideology, economy and geography—stand out. While it is a mistake to exaggerate the role of ideational factors such as anti-communism, democratic values and national identity, it is erroneous to disregard their influence. Given their relatively small and weak economies, Taiwan’s allies are dependent on foreign economic assistance. Geographical factors are no less important. While distance has a diminishing effect on China’s influence over Taiwan’s allies, Taiwan by virtue of its affluence is able to exercise its economic influence, since its allies are generally small, lack natural resources, and are prone to natural disasters.
This study shows that major national leaders figure prominently in the diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. The general public’s lack of interest in foreign policy, especially issues related to low politics, has allowed leaders in both democratic and undemocratic countries to enjoy greater leverage in foreign policy than in domestic policy. What makes leaders in small developing countries more willing to dominate diplomacy is their enormous, and sometimes urgent, need for foreign assistance. Moreover, leaders of Taiwan’s allies, due to the countries’ domestic structures and cultures, are more authoritarian and less responsive than their counterparts in mature democracies. Their diplomatic recognition of Taiwan may or may not work in their countries’ best interest, but often serves their personal interests.
Small states and great powers alike seek to survive and thrive in an anarchical world, and their foreign policies are shaped by their national interests, national power and national leaders. This similarity, however, should not blind us to their differences. By dint of their limited power, small states are, to a greater extent, constrained by the existing international system. Smaller states, given their narrow resource base, also rely heavily on diplomacy to meet their domestic needs. For their part, major leaders of smaller states tend to dominate the foreign policy-making, which is facilitated by the domestic structures and cultures in their countries.

Abstract. In recent decades, Sweden has redefined its basic security policy orientation from neutrality to military non-alignment. In response to migration crisis in Europe and increasing tensions between the EU and Russia caused by the Ukrainian crisis, Sweden is increasing military spending and deepening military cooperation with other countries in the Baltic region and NATO.
This study seeks to analyze the concepts of neutrality and non-alignment within Swedish security policy, existing threats to national security and demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks of full NATO membership. Alternative measures to increase the security of Sweden are also presented.
Key words: neutrality, non-alignment, Sweden, defense policy, security policy, threat, military cooperation, NATO

Introduction
Swedish defense policy has changed dramatically in recent decades. For more than 200 years, Sweden was recognized as a neutral state. Neutral status insured Sweden against the sufferings of the World Wars and involvement in the confrontation of the Blocks during the Cold War. However, once the Cold War ended and the security environment changed, Sweden was driven towards transformation of its security policy.
The article seeks to analyze Sweden’s current security policy orientation by answering the following questions: What are the concepts of neutrality and nonalignment security policy, and are they still relevant? How can the security policy of Sweden be characterized in terms of these concepts? What are the options to develop the security policy of Sweden?
The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of Swedish security policy with a clear empirical policy focus.
The study is based on analysis of the documents on Swedish defense and security policy, official government statements and reports, but also on interviews with Swedish experts and representatives of civil society made by the author during an internship in Stockholm March-April 2017. The following main questions were asked:
- What was the cause of the intensification of the debate on Sweden’s possible joining the NATO?
- How do you assess Sweden-Russia relations?
- Is Sweden a neutral state? Why?
- What is your opinion on the issue of accession of Sweden to NATO? Why?
Clarification questions were also asked.
This paper has more practical value, rather than theoretical, therefore the theoretical issues are not developed here. The results of the study could be useful both for policy-makers and for future analytical studies on Swedish security policy.

Lost in definitions
The problem of terms and their definitions is quite common in modern science. Many of the concepts may have different definitions. To avoid confusion in this study, the terms ‘neutrality’ and ‘non alignment’ must be defined and distinguished.

Neutrality is commonly understood as policies aimed at avoiding participation or assistance in a dispute or war between others. According to the dictionary definition, “neutrality is not aligned with or supporting any side or position in a controversy” (dictionary.com, 2017). All the neutral states are divided into two groups:
• Permanently neutral states, for instance, Switzerland and Austria;
• Non-permanently (temporarily, during the given wartime) neutral states.
Hague Conventions Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land and in Naval War establish the following:
- The transit of the troops of the warring parties, food cargoes and military cargoes is forbidden
- Corps of combatants cannot be formed nor recruiting agencies opened on the territory of a neutral Power to assist the belligerents;
- It is forbidden to organize the station of wireless telegraphy or other means of communication with belligerent forces;
- It is forbidden to pass warships, ammunition, or any war material to belligerents on any base (Hague Convention V, 1910).
An integral part of the policy of neutrality is non-alignment. The concept was especially relevant during the Cold War and used to describe the states’ policy of not supporting or participating in military blocs (NATO or Warsaw Treaty Organization). The main idea of the policy was standing outside of any bloc’s sphere of influence. Once the USSR collapsed and the bloc system of international relations terminated its existence, ‘non-alignment’ lost its original significance, as did ‘neutrality’: definitions of these terms gradually changed because of the transformation of political reality. For that reason, the flexibility of the terms allows politicians to interpret them in the way which is the most suitable in each given situation; furthermore, in some cases the terms are used as synonyms (Gyldén, 2014).

Still neutral?
A common misconception about Sweden is that it has been neutral since signing the Convention of Moss in 1814. Indeed, Sweden formally has not been a side in an armed conflict since that time. For almost 200 years, the neutrality policy was aimed at isolating Sweden from the rest of war-torn Europe. As it was mentioned above, neutrality status can be permanent or temporary. However, Sweden’s neutrality is less clear.

WP 2017-02

In the case of Sweden, a more fair statement is that Sweden maintained neutrality during wartime, though this is also controversial. For instance, Sweden willingly traded with the Nazi Germany during World War II; furthermore, the Swedes let Germany transit personnel and equipment through their territory. Although the moral aspect of those actions is ambiguous, staying out of the war was vitally important for Sweden. The experience of Denmark and Norway demonstrates that a neutral status by itself could not guarantee safety. Thus, the concessions were rational: Sweden avoided the invasion of the Nazi troops and maintained its sovereignty. However, there is another example, it is known now, that Sweden had secret agreements on mutual defense with the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) in case of Soviet aggression (Holmström, 2011).
The neutrality of Sweden has never been stated in the constitution or any international treaty. It provided Sweden with an opportunity to be flexible in its security policy: in the 1990s Sweden easily shifted its security policy to nonalignment and became an EU member state in 1995 and, consequently, a part of the common defense and security policy (CSDP). “Of Sweden’s three official cold war ‘policy pillars’ – independence, neutrality in wartime and military nonalignment – only military non-alignment remains relevant. Independence has become interdependence, and neutrality is no longer the only, or even the most likely, option should there be a war in Europe” (Bailes et al., 2006).
According to the Inquiry on Sweden’s International Defense report, Sweden conducts a policy of military non-alignment “the essence of which is that Sweden does not extend mutual defense obligations to other countries” (Inquiry on Sweden’s International Defence and Security Cooperation, 2015).
And yet, there is a question: how can this policy line coexist with EU membership? It is evident that the policy of non-alignment with the given definition contradicts the Common Security and Defense Policy and the Lisbon Treaty commitments. However, the Swedish leaders define the CSDP as cooperation in the field of crisis management which does not contradict their policy orientation as crisis management operations do not require direct military involvement in a conflict. As concerns the Solidarity Clause of the Lisbon Treaty, it is restricted by Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union that claims the following: “prejudice the specific character of the security and defense policy of certain Member States” (Consolidate Version of the Treaty on European Union, 2008).
As the majority of the EU states are also NATO members, Sweden, which is not obliged to assist by these organizations’ commitments, has an advantage. Theoretically, if Sweden is attacked, Germany or France, for instance, will not stay outside the conflict due to Solidarity Clause of the Lisbon Treaty. Thus, Sweden is under protection of not only the EU, but also NATO.

To a large extent, as Mike Winnerstig, a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences (Kungliga Krigsvetenskapsakademien) stated, Sweden’s neutrality has turned into an “ideology and a part of Sweden’s identity… being a Swede is being neutral no matter what. It doesn't matter if it's completely out of touch with reality” (The Local, 2014).

Swedish perception of threats
The shifts in the defense and security policy of Sweden depend very heavily on the perception of threats. The given list of existing threats is based on analysis of official government statements and speeches1. Both global and local threats are presented in the list.
Russian aggressive foreign policy. The Ukrainian crisis and Russian foreign policy towards it undermined stability in the European region. Since 2014, after the Crimean referendum on its inclusion into Russia, the aggressive foreign policy of Russia has become more frequently mentioned as a threat to Sweden’s and other Baltic States security in official statements and speeches by Swedish politicians. They are concerned about Russia attempts to regain the ""greatness of the Motherland"" and once again become a world power” (Hultqvist, 2017). Nevertheless, the Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Löfven stated that there was no direct military threat to the country (Löfven, 2016).
Migration. Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and North Africa and the imperfection of migration policy provoked a huge wave of refugees to apply for asylum in Sweden. This results in numerous challenges: from the integration of immigrants into Swedish society to the cost of maintenance allowance and increasing crime rate. In recent years, Sweden has become an asylum for more than a hundred thousand refugees. The figure below shows the dynamic of asylum-seekers number over the past 5 years.

Fig. 1. The total number of asylum applications in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017
As you can see from figure 1, the number of asylum-seekers dramatically decreased from 2015 to 2016: the reason is restrictions of migration policy; in particular Sweden restored border control “in order to verify the legal right to enter and stay in the country” (Temporary border control).
Terrorism. The threat is not of the national level, but global. Currently, it has become a “new normal”. In recent years, Europe has suffered from terrorist attacks several times (Wallström, 2017a). Modern terrorism is hard to prevent as it has changed in form: people are encouraged to make an attack in their homeland from a distance, usually abroad; so, a man, who makes an attack is just an agent. After the terrorist attack on April 7, 2017, Sweden, which has been always recognized as the safest country in the world, faced the reality of this threat. The increasing level of terrorism in Sweden is closely connected to the previous threat in this list.
North Korea’s nuclear weapons. During 2017, North Korea fired 22 missiles of different range. Rapid development of Pyongyang’s missile program generated uncertainty in the world politics. Yet, the hostile rhetoric of the US President Donald Trump at the 72th UN General Assembly entirely set the world on the verge of nuclear war (The Associated Press, 2017). In such circumstances, in the author’s opinion, Sweden, as a state which has traditionally been active in the promotion of non proliferation and, in the end, elimination of nuclear weapons and, at the same time, a neutral state could be a mediator in the dialogue between the USA and North Korea aimed at preventing an armed conflict.
Climate change. In today’s context climate change has become a security issue. For instance, global warming causes the thinning of the Arctic icecap which, in turn, has its own aftermaths. First and foremost, deglaciation raises the sea level and causes flooding, which poses an existential threat to some European states. Secondly, ice-melting permits more opportunities to develop

the Arctic and increases interest in the region which is still a bone of contention. Thirdly, while some countries are at risk of being flooded, others suffer from drought: poor yields and hunger force migration. “Climate change will make the world a less safe place in many ways. Lack of food and water is a great driver of conflict. It is high time we made the connection between climate and security” (Wallström, 2017b).
Cyber security threat (Löfven, 2017b). It is hardly possible to imagine modern society without the use of high technologies in everyday life: people have become heavily reliant on hi-tech and, thus, are vulnerable to cyber-attack. One click could cut off a city from the electricity or lower a dam’s floodgates, a series of cyber-attacks could deprive people of vital services. Technologies make things easier and our life more comfortable, but at the same time they make us vulnerable.
Considering the above-mentioned threats, the government seeks to develop Sweden’s defense and security policy. The Swedish Defense Bill 2016-2020 contains a paragraph, within which an independent expert’s report on different options for “cooperation and/or membership with countries and organizations (including NATO)” needs to be presented (The Swedish Defense Bill 20162020, 2015). It goes on to say that the Swedish policy of non-alignment should not be an obstacle to research (ibid.). That fact shows significant changes in Sweden’s security policy and raises the question of whether Sweden is on the way to full NATO membership.

NATO: To be or not to be?
Recently full NATO-membership has become a sensitive issue for the Swedes. Russian foreign policy towards Ukraine and, therefore, the increasing level of mistrust and tensions in the Baltic region significantly influenced intensification of the debate.
However, the nature and original purposes of NATO should not be forgotten. NATO was founded as a military-political, defensive alliance to deter Soviet expansion. This purpose was relevant during the Cold War until the USSR collapsed. At that moment NATO faced an existential crisis and tried to find a new mission. It shifted to maintenance of global security through promoting democratic values and undertaking peacekeeping and crisis-management operations. Despite having a new mission, Russia-NATO relations remain suspicious: both sides assess the other as a threat.
So, is there a place for Sweden in the Alliance? The official position remains the same: the current Swedish government opposes the idea of joining NATO (Tal av Peter Hulqvist…, 2017). However, attitudes to NATO membership differ in the Riksdag. While the ruling coalition of Social Democrats and Greens stands for close cooperation between Sweden and NATO including joint exercises and participation in peacekeeping operations within the framework of the

“Partnership for Peace” program, they tend to support remaining formally nonaligned. Hence, they consider Sweden’s military non-alignment contributes to the security stability in region (Radio Sweden, 2016).
As for opposition parties, which are the Moderate party, Centre party, Liberal People’s party and Christian Democrats, they are traditionally supporters of NATO, and recognize the Alliance as a guarantor of regional security.

Table 1. Position on NATO membership in the Riksdag
Table 1 demonstrates that the majority of Riksdag representatives do not support joining NATO, however, the forthcoming elections in September 2018 theoretically could change the proportions.
The ongoing debate on the issue divides not only the Riksdag, but also society into two camps: NATO advocates and opponents. Public polls of recent years indicate the majority of the Swedes do not support the idea of joining the Alliance. Nevertheless, year-to-year results of the polls differ. In 2015 public support for joining NATO reached the record of 41 percent, but dropped to 33 percent by 2016 (Nilsson, 2015).
As public support is highly important in the decision-making process on the issue of joining NATO, delicate policy could be conducted by the politicians to change public opinion in favor of membership of in the Alliance. For instance, media could be used not only as a tool to inform, but also as a tool to influence the formation of public opinion. The case with the Russian submarine in the Stockholm archipelago in 2014 is a great example of how it works. Sweden’s military spent several days searching for what officially was called “foreign underwater activity” (The Guardian, 2014). However, local media, with reference to Sweden’s intelligence services, suggested that it was a Russian submarine on a secret mission, which had mechanical problems (ibid.). One year after the search operation it was officially announced that nothing had been revealed and all the proofs were not applicable (Sveriges radio, 2016).

That fact allows us to conclude that media may have been used as a political tool to deteriorate the image of Russia in society, which subsequently may affect the decision-making process on full membership in NATO. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages of joining the Alliance
Clarity. While Sweden strengthens ties with NATO without joining the Alliance, it is difficult to foresee its behavior in a crisis. As a researcher in Swedish Defence Research Agency Tomas Malmlöf justly noted during an interview, “It is hard to play a game, when nobody knows the rules” (T. Malmlöf, personal communication, March 23, 2017). In the Swedish case, full membership would clarify its defense policy and consequently provide stability and increase trust among all Baltic Sea states. The key argument against is that membership would conversely irritate Russia. Here it is worth mentioning that expansion of NATO closer to Russia’s borders is regarded as a substantial threat to its national security. It is obvious that Russia would react to diminish the threat. In June 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin commented on the issue, ""… it does not mean that we will get hysterical and get our missiles ready, but we will think about an appropriate response” (UNIAN Information Agency, 2017). Still, the membership would bring Swedish security policy out of the twilight zone.
Security guaranties. For the current moment, Sweden is highly integrated into NATO structures, and it is still deepening cooperation with the Alliance. It is reasonable to assume that Sweden seeks to be protected by NATO. Nevertheless, NATO former Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen forewarned Sweden that it could not count on assistance from NATO while it is not a member (Sveriges Radio, 2013).
Responsibility for maintaining peace and stability in the Baltic region. The Baltic Sea region is traditionally unstable due to geopolitical factors, as it unites the states with different political orientations – NATO member-states (Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Germany), neutral Sweden and Finland, and Russia. Despite the EU solidarity principle, Sweden, as well as Finland, still has options on how to react in cases of crisis or attack.
Influence. Being a member of NATO, Sweden could participate in the decision making process and influence the Alliance’s activities to a different extent. Thus, Sweden would have an additional platform to promote its interests.
Increase of military spending. Sweden has decreased defense spending in the last 10 years: from 1.3% of GDP in 2006 to 1.0% of GDP in 2016 (The World Bank, 2016). If Sweden becomes a full NATO member-state, it will have to undertake military spending at 2% of GDP and above. However, only five of 29 NATO member-states (namely, USA, Greece, Poland, Estonia and the United Kingdom) have implemented this requirement. The reason is that it has declarative character and there is no penalty for failure.

Meanwhile some opponents of NATO suggest very radical solutions of the security issues, including military spending. The activist of the organization “No to NATO membership” (“Nej till NATO”), Pelle Sunvisson in the interview pointed out that ensuring the state’s defense capability is expensive for society, and abandonment of military forces would allow the government to redirect the budget to other spheres, for instance, to the social sector. In addition, he suggested, “if Sweden abolishes armed forces, it will provide a security of a brand new level” (P. Sunvisson, personal communication, April 5, 2017). By that, he refers to two main ideas:
• None of the countries would attack defenseless state due to the moral consideration.
• In case of aggression, unarmed state could rely on assistance from other countries.
The suggestion is questionable; it contradicts the basic concept of any defense policies: inability to repel threats causes them to emerge.
Freedom of actions restriction. As a full member of the Alliance, Sweden would be bound by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, which contains the main principle of collective defense, an aggression against one is considered as an aggression against all the participants (The North Atlantic Treaty, 1949). Hence, Sweden risks being dragged into unwilling conflict.
NATO nuclear strategy. The Article 5 of the Washington Treaty urges the members of the Alliance to use all means to assist that member, which is attacked. The article could be interpreted in such a way that nuclear weapons are acceptable to be used in case of emergency. However, such a situation is totally unsustainable for Sweden as cornerstones of its position on nuclear weapons are non-proliferation and prohibition. And yet, there are no obligatory treaties within NATO concerning nuclear weapons.
Theoretically, if Sweden signs the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and then joins NATO, it will establish a precedent and spur a chain reaction: other NATO-umbrella states may join the Treaty. Thus, it would have considerable impact on NATO nuclear states and the nuclear disarmament process.

Options for the development of security policy
In the Parliamentary Debate on Foreign Affairs in February of 2008 former prime-minister Carl Bild noted “… the future security of our country is founded on community and cooperation with other countries” (Statement of Government Policy in the Parliamentary Debate on Foreign Affairs, 2008). And this is the case, in the new reality of the contemporary world, where all the states are interdependent, the security of one state is based not only on national defense,

13

WP 2017-02

but more often on international defense cooperation. It is hardly conceivable that a crisis in one state would not affect its neighbouring states or even further afield. That is why international cooperation on security and defense is essential.
Self-defense. It is the less preferable option, as it requires high military spending. Currently, despite having modern and hi-tech military equipment, Sweden is unable to defend itself by its own means. As the former Supreme Commander, Sverker Göransson, stated “Sweden could only hold out for a week if it were attacked” (Nilsson, 2015).
Besides, it is hard just to suppose that Sweden will be face-to-face in case of an attack against it. Nevertheless, it is reckless to count solely on external assistance.: Sweden should have its own strong military capability to resist threats.
Bilateral cooperation. The bilateral agreements between Sweden and Finland in the field of military cooperation have proven their credibility through the longterm. In autumn 2013, the two countries announced the intent to continue defense cooperation with the aim of increasing security and stability in the region, but also to establish a better use of resources and cost-efficiency in defense-related areas.
The joint final report, published on January 31, 2015 includes the following steps for cooperation:
“- the development of a bilateral standing Naval Task Group, The SwedishFinnish Naval Task Group (SFNTG), with full operational capability by 2023,
- an increased level of interoperability between the Swedish and Finnish Air Forces with the capacity for joint operation, common base operations and common command and control (C2) capability;
- the development of a combined Finnish - Swedish Brigade Framework” (Final reports on deepened defence cooperation between Finland and Sweden, 2015).
By strengthening bilateral Swedish-Finish defense cooperation, Sweden improves its own and regional security, reaffirms its commitment to a policy of military non-alignment and thereby adjusts relations with Russia.
Multilateral cooperation. Multilateral defense cooperation is currently the most appropriate way to ensure security. It requires for every side’s efforts and opportunities to eliminate threats of any level. Besides, cooperation is based on a dialog, within which the sides agree on acceptable measures to counter threats. “…the fact that collaboration between nations often produces win-win situations and common security is well documented. The EU is one good example – perhaps one of the most successful peace projects the world has ever seen” (Wallström, 2017b).

Conclusion
In the era of globalization, the concept of neutrality has lost its relevance. The increasing significance of joint response to new challenges and threats to the world’s stability and security has become evident during the last few decades. Integration processes and their advantages caused a shift in the security policy of Sweden from traditional neutrality to military non-alignment, which could hardly be distinguished in terms of their definitions.
According to this study, analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of joining the Alliance, benefits of Sweden’s NATO membership prevail. Nevertheless, keeping in mind neutrality policy, which enabled Sweden to stay out of the World Wars and not to be under the sphere of influences of any military block during the Cold War, the Swedes are not in a hurry to join the Alliance.
Besides, despite the disputes in the Riksdag, the ruling coalition of the Social Democrats and the Greens retains the policy of non-alignment, meanwhile strengthening ties with NATO. Thus, Sweden is not a neutral or non-aligned state in the classic sense: it is balancing between the Alliance and declared non-alignment status according to its national interests. Currently, there is no vital need for Sweden to join the Alliance, now the country is in a win-win position: according to the Lisbon Treaty, in case of aggression it would be protected by the EU-member states, the majority of which are also NATOstates.

Revolutionary protests in Ukraine in winter 2014 resulted in the annexation of Crimea by Russia, and an anti-terrorist operation launched by Kiev in eastern Ukraine. What was a totally internal manifestation of displeasure with governmental policy transformed into an international security crisis. While Kiev considers it a Russian–Ukrainian conﬂict, Moscow perceives it as a Russian–West confrontation, claiming that the crisis was provoked by NATO’s desire to enlarge into the region where Russia’s vital interests lie. The article analyses the sources of the current Ukrainian–Russian conﬂict and looks into Russia’s place in post-crisis Ukraine. As history has shown, even those states which used to ﬁght each other for centuries managed not only to ﬁnd peace but to establish constructive relationships. Still, with the shift from material to ideological confrontation, there are fewer and fewer options for compromise.
Keywords: Ukraine; Russia; Crimea; geopolitics; Black Sea; Ukrainian crisis; security
Introduction: the context of the Ukrainian crisis To think of the current Ukrainian–Russian crisis as an exaggerated reaction to the Euromaidan protests in Kiev and the Ukrainian government’s decision not to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union, indicates short-sightedness and overlooks the chain of smaller scale crises and problems which preceded and led to the confrontation of 2014–2015. Issues of gas supply and NATO enlargement have been more or less discussed and analysed frequently in academia and the policy community, usually from the realism point of view – making reference to national interests, spheres of inﬂuence and commercial rationality. However, issues such as perception of the common history of Russian and Ukrainian peoples, inability to present Russia’s greatness without the history of Kiev Rus, the role of language and ‘great Russian culture’ (mostly referring to the Soviet or at least Russian Empire – not to mix with the ethnic perspective) in Ukrainian society, have attracted less attention.
Using the term ‘Ukrainian crisis’ to refer to the whole course of events since November 2013 is not actually appropriate. The situation that emerged between November 2013 and March 2014, the so-called Euromaidan, can be called a ‘Ukrainian crisis’ as indeed hundreds of thousands of people stood against the regime of President Viktor Yanukovych demanding to stop corruption, to proceed

with the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, and with democratic reforms. Those events took place in Ukraine and were about Ukraine. The events following March 2014 are not anymore just about Ukraine. They are more about Russia’s fear of a Maidan of its own, about exercising control in its ‘spheres of interests and inﬂuence’ and about contradictions between the East and the West, as perceived by Russia. The perception that the Euromaidan had been initiated by the United States (US) and that NATO’s main concern is the deployment of its forces in the Crimea, is still overshadowing the decision-making logic in Moscow. While Ukrainians see the current crisis as an issue of democratic development, for Russia it is framed in geopolitical logic of world affairs. According to D’Anieri (2015, 234)

[e]ither geopolitical explanation would lead us to expect that Russia will seek to stabilize some revised status quo. The domestic explanation leads us to believe that Russia will seek to prevent any level of stability that enables a territorially truncated Ukraine to proceed with domestic reform and closer ties with Europe.

The conﬂict in eastern Ukraine is not over yet but the discourse about Russia losing Ukraine instead of bringing it closer has been going on almost since the beginning of the crisis. Ukrainian and Russian analysts alike have been attempting to predict the outcome of the crisis and what will follow after; still much will depend on how the crisis will end. Acknowledging the limitations of forecasting while the conﬂict is still developing, this article looks into the sources of the current situation and if there is a place for Russia in post-crisis Ukraine.

What preceded the Ukrainian crisis
Throughout the post-Cold War period, Russian politicians have been sending signals that NATO is ‘taboo’ and perceived as an aggressive military bloc whose expansion threatens Moscow’s interests, while the enlargement of the European Union to the East was not posing problems. Moreover, ‘from Moscow, Ukrainian politics was seen as identical to Russian – strong central authorities, effective consolidation and distribution of resources by the center, developed administrative apparatus and the most important – consensus of elites and society on national interests’ (Cyшeнцoв 2015). In reality, for many in Russia, it was difﬁcult to see Ukraine as a separate sovereign entity with a more developed democratic political culture. Despite serious corruption and numerous political crises, Ukrainian civil society and politicians after the Orange Revolution behaved in a different way, not accepting power monopoly and authoritarian manners. The pro-European Union choice of many Ukrainians expressed the desire to bring fundamental changes to the overall development model of the country, ﬁrst of all, in terms of democracy, human rights, economic development and ﬁghting corruption. Thus, the choice of European integration was not a choice against Russia. Political competition among different Ukrainian parties and the diverse views within the parties on issues such as the EU and NATO integration did not allow for monopolization of public discourse on foreign policy. Even the ruling, at that time, Party of Regions had not consolidated its position as pro-Russian or anti-European, adopting legislation facilitating association with the EU; however, at the same time, spreading, for example, fake information on gay marriages legalization as a pre-requite for EU visa liberalization (Kiev Post 2013).

Diverse views inside Ukraine on the country’s foreign policy orientation were necessarily undermining its sovereignty. Thus, as Sherr mentions (2008) those who opposed integration with NATO dared not oppose the ‘European course’ while those who warned that Ukraine cannot be ‘turned against’ Russia dared not allow the Russian vector to become the determinant vector of their policy.
As for Ukraine’s integration with NATO, this issue has not been on the agenda almost since the 2008 Bucharest Summit, when the Alliance rejected Membership Action Plans for Ukraine and Georgia, due to the active lobbying of Moscow against such a decision. In 2010, Ukraine ofﬁcially rejected the NATO membership perspective by adopting a new Foreign Policy Doctrine and announcing the so-called ‘non-bloc status’. Since then, the issue of NATO-Ukraine cooperation has been almost absent both in the academic and political discourse of the country. By the end of 2013, only 13% of the population was supporting membership of Ukraine in NATO (International Republican Institute 2014). Even after Euromaidan events, the new Ukrainian Government mostly agreed that membership was not on the agenda and an immediate application to join NATO was untimely. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuing ﬁghting in Eastern Ukraine has changed Ukrainians’ attitude towards NATO, and in parallel by intensifying cooperation with the Alliance – raised Russian suspicions to a new level.
Thus, Russian fears about the possible deployment of NATO military bases in Ukraine are not justiﬁed as there has been no consideration of such an option either in Kiev or Brussels. Even when Kiev had opted for NATO membership in 2008, there were not any discussions on the deployment of additional NATO bases in Ukraine or that the Russian ﬂeet should withdraw before the end of its term (2017) as it had been agreed upon in 1997. Moreover, by 2014, nobody challenged the disputable prolongation of the Russian Black Sea Fleet deployment in Crimea until 2042, which was agreed in 2010 and had caused serious political disputes in Ukraine, perceived by opposition parties to be in violation of the Constitution.
According to Snyder (2014), by 2013, Moscow no longer represented simply a Russian state with more or less calculable interests, but rather a much grander project of Eurasian integration. The Eurasian project was based on two pillars: the creation of a free trade bloc between Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan; and the destruction of the European Union through the support of European far right political powers. This Eurasian project has not been articulated purely in economic terms, but ideas of joint cultural, religious and historical unity among Eurasian partners have been employed extensively. In the case of Ukraine, it was manifested in two ways. On the one hand, there has been marginalization of the role of Ukraine in the joint history, insistence by many in Moscow on its non-existing as a state and even artiﬁciality of Ukrainian language and culture, presented as something like a dialect of Russian. Thus, the use of terms such as ‘Small Russia’ in reference to Ukraine has been extensive in main Russian TV channels. On the other hand, there have been systematic efforts in building the concept of a so-called ‘Russian world’, including the myth of the necessity to protect the use of the Russian language and the creation of a camp of pro-Russian politicians. To some extent, such a policy could be explained by the idea that the greatness of the Russian Federation, based on the Russian Empire glory and power of the Soviet Union, will not be possible without the ancient past of Kiev Rus, or Ukrainians’ contribution to Soviet development. This is demonstrated in the arguments used by Moscow in favour of the Crimea annexation. In March 2014, the annexation of Crimea was justiﬁed by the

need to support the Russian population and the necessity to stop NATO forces’ deployment in Crimea. But in December 2014, President Putin said that ‘Crimea, ancient Korsun, Khersones, Sevastopol – all of them bear an enormous civilizational and sacral meaning for Russia, just as the Temple Mount of Jerusalem does for those who profess Islam and Judaism’ (Schreck 2014) because Grand Prince Vladimir was baptized there in 988 AD after which Christianity came to Kiev Rus – almost two centuries before the ﬁrst mention of Moscow appeared in chronicles.
According to Russian military expert, Pavel Felgengauer, Russia, is preparing for a new world war, which could happen by 2025. This is expected to be a war
for resources where the US would be the main enemy. Because of this, there is a
necessity for Moscow to establish a defence perimeter, and Ukraine is exactly part
of such a perimeter. Losing Ukraine would mean that Moscow would be vulnerable to threats (Бoлoтoв 2015). Consequently, controlling Ukraine is seen by Moscow as a vital interest, for which the use of any means is justiﬁed. Along with statements in April 2008 by the Head of the Russian General Staff, Y. Baluyevskiy that
Russia can use military and other means in case Ukraine and Georgia join NATO to secure its interests on the borders (Hoвocти 2008), an article appeared in Russian media discussing a detailed plan of possible military occupation of Ukraine. Interestingly such military actions were called ‘operation of liberation of Ukraine’ (Джaдaн 2008). That article was widely circulated and perceived as provocative and a trial balloon, describing three scenarios of capturing Ukraine:
occupation of Crimea; occupation of the Black Sea regions and East of Ukraine;
occupying the previous regions plus Kiev. The detailed description of military
forces and of strategic and tactical plans to be deployed led many experts to believe that this article had been elaborated at the ofﬁces of the Russian General Staff rather than being the product of journalistic work.

The current situation
For a long time, Ukrainian society has separated its perception of Russian citizens and of the Kremlin’s policy. However, active involvement of Russian combatants and support of such involvement by Russian society has changed the perception of Ukrainian citizens dramatically. Slogans of the Euromaidan were not anti-Russian, but pro-European, perceived by most Ukrainians as not antagonistic to each other but complementary. However, the abrupt shift of the Ukrainian President’s and government’s opinion on the signing of the Association Agreement, perceived as the result of Moscow’s pressure, made protestors use expressions such as ‘Putin if you loves us, let us go’, emphasizing the trigger for the Ukrainian government’s policy shifts. It was not until Crimea’s annexation and Russian citizens’ total support of this action that relations between the two peoples, Ukrainians and Russians, gradually spoiled. According to D’Anieri (2015), one of the reasons of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, at least in part,
was to prevent the transnational spread of revolution from Ukraine to Russia. If postrevolution Ukraine were to succeed as a stable, prosperous, liberal democracy tied closely to Europe, this would fundamentally undermine the claim that Russia cannot succeed as a liberal democracy.
In 2009, Pifer (2009) in his Contingency Planning Memorandum ‘Crisis between Ukraine and Russia’ predicted two possible scenarios that could generate a crisis

Southeast European and Black Sea Studies

195

between Kiev and Moscow in Crimea – one scenario was foreseeing the use of the Russian navy based in Crimea in actions against Georgia which would not then be allowed by Kiev to return; another scenario was foreseeing the escalation of the dispute on the terms and duration of the stationing of the Russian Black Sea Force in Crimea. None of these scenarios came true, as the world was faced with a third scenario; that of direct annexation of Crimea. In 2010, Buba (2010) wrote for the International Affairs Review that ‘[w]hile the Russo-Ukrainian dispute over natural gas has dominated international political discourse in recent months, it is Crimea that has the long-term potential to become a ﬂashpoint for future conﬂict in bilateral relations’.
The Ukrainian Parliament adopted a decision recognizing the Russian Federation as a state-aggressor only in January 2015 despite having a legal right to name Russian actions as aggressive already by March 2014. According to the UN General Assembly resolution 3314 (1974), which states seven cases deﬁning aggressive activities, including ‘the blockade of the ports or coasts of a State by the armed forces of another state’. Consequently, the blockade of the Ukrainian navy in Donuzlav Bay in March 2014 by sinking ﬁve Russian navy ships already could be considered as an aggressive act. Kiev took a slow path in reacting, and it is true that Crimean annexation could easily happen as the Ukrainian military were not able to respond appropriately, primarily due to the inability to comprehend that the enemy is Russia.
By cancelling the Budapest Memorandum, Russia lost its credibility in the eyes of Ukrainians in terms of security guarantees. Signed in 1994, even though just a Memorandum without any legally binding norms, the Budapest Memorandum was a symbol of respect of Ukrainian sovereignty and security in exchange for giving up its nuclear state status. In 2009, former US Ambassador to Ukraine, Steven Pifer, named Russian instigation or support of an effort by Crimea to break away from Ukraine as the worst – and most unlikely – case after which Kiev would appeal to Washington under the 1994 Budapest memorandum on security assurances, citing Russia’s threat to Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity (Pifer 2009). The Crimean case could be an ideal test for respecting obligations under this Memorandum, to which Ukraine was referring, but two of three signatories – the US and the UK were not able to react appropriately.
Even if the Crimean case was more about territorial claims based on historical memories of past Russian glory (Sevastopol as a city of the Russian navy glory), the Donbas region is a totally different case. It has never been associated historically with Russia, while support of the Russian-speaking population is only an excuse, as nobody violated their rights, and even more, the rural areas of Donbass are more Ukrainian-speaking. What Moscow aims at is the destabilization of this industrially developed region which would serve two goals. First, it could weaken the feeble Ukrainian economy, creating a deep crisis that would not allow the full implementation of Association Agreement with the EU. Second, it could destabilize Ukraine politically, as this region is the motherland of the former Ukrainian President V. Yanukovych. Evidence to the ‘non-necessity’ of the land bear is the total devastation of the critical infrastructure and industry that bring revenue to the local economy (in addition to the infrastructure that can be used by the military), and the number of mercenaries ﬁghting there.
In the Kremlin’s view, Crimea should be a success story, which would bring more Ukrainians closer to Russia, and become an exemplary case of socio-economic

development and the so-called peaceful will of local populations to be with Russia. However, Crimean annexation has become a success story only in Russian domestic politics, raising V. Putin’s rating inside Russia, but it remains a failure internationally and of course inside Ukraine. Respondents to the sociological survey made in the Odessa region in November 2014 noted a decline in pro-Russian sentiments due to the situation in Crimea. Respondents said that they ‘began to assess more adequately consequences this all can lead to’, and chose social stability over foreign policy orientation (Kribosheya, Serbina, and Shelest 2015). However, respondents expressed the view that

the cause of secession of Crimea is a result that for 23 years of independence, Ukraine has virtually ignored some regions, including Crimea, and if to project this situation to our (Odessa region) region, we are just in the same situation.

Therefore, there is a concern about possible social discontent there, as in Crimea. For example, sentiments among the population of small towns and villages of
the South of Odessa region are perceived to be pro-Russian or even ‘pro-Putin’. This is mostly explained by economic reasons, as Russia was the main market for agricultural products, which are now losing out to the Russian market. Furthermore, on historical grounds, it was during the period of the Russian Empire that the allocation of land to the people of the region took place, at the time when serfdom was spread in other territories. The Soviet Union was a period of economic prosperity of ‘Prydunavya’ (Near Danube region), while during the last 20 years, it has transformed into a depressed region with ports being closed and signiﬁcant deterioration of socio-economic situation. That is why residents of this region have considerable nostalgia for the old days that are automatically associated with modern Russia (Kribosheya, Serbina, and Shelest 2015).
The cities of Kharkiv and Odessa were perceived as next in a row of Russian aggression aspiration, or at least as those regions which would demonstrate the most pro-Russian and anti-Ukrainian position. Military actions in Donbas calmed such pro-Russian sentiments, which were based more on cultural elements rather than politics. The attempts to destabilize two cities through socio-economic means, propaganda and often terrorist acts in winter 2015 have not been successful. Despite the fear that Odessa could be invaded from Transnistria by a Russian army aiming to unite all regions from Donbas to Transnistria via Crimea, this scenario, though it remains still on the agenda, has become less possible.
The Russian invasion has changed the internal discourse in Ukraine dramatically. The terms Russian (ethnically), Russian-speaking and Pro-Russian are referred to as three different notions, bringing the value of citizenship (Ukrainian) above ethnic background, as those which do not contradict one another, as it was before. Though the issue of the rights of the Russian-speaking population had been actively manipulated before, since 2014, the general approach has been one of ‘we need nobody’s protection’, meaning that nobody violates their rights and this pretext should not be used as a reason for invasion. For more and more people in Ukraine, the Russian language is ceasing to be a part of their self-identiﬁcation and close connection with the Russian Federation, which is more and more perceived as Kremlin and the concept of ‘Russian world’, rather than Russian culture and common history. In some way, pro-Russian sentiments today are another way of expressing pro-Soviet feelings, which oppose the European aspirations of Ukrainians.

At the same time, the Russian perception of the course of events is problematic. While Ukraine perceives this crisis as a bilateral one, i.e. Russian–Ukrainian, the Russian political and academic establishment presents it as a clash of interests of such key actors as Russia, the EU and the US, raising the importance of this interstate conﬂict to regional and global levels (Гyщин and Mapкeдoнoв 2014). Thus, according to the Russian media, the Euromaidan revolution had been initiated by the West, just like the anti-terrorist operation, when regular propaganda took place. The Russian military and government were refusing to acknowledge the improving military capabilities of the Ukrainian army, claiming that a ‘NATO legion’ is ﬁghting in Ukraine (Лaтyxинa 2015). The tremendous mobilization of the Ukrainian population and the de facto birth of the volunteering movement were the main pillars of support for the military that had been destroyed by the previous regime, while they facilitated the localization of the conﬂict in Donbas and triggered reforms, including in the security sector (logistics, training, management systems, accountability, etc.).
The current crisis violates all basic principles and norms of international law and practices. Even during the Cold War period, predictability in interstate affairs was higher, while the two superpowers tried to keep their policies within certain agreed-upon frameworks. Diplomatic efforts have been undermined by the supply of strategic missiles to irregular military groups, cases of journalists carrying weapons, reports on humanitarian aid convoys carrying non-humanitarian goods and not permitting checks by the Red Cross, ‘green men’ and military ‘on vacation’ in the conﬂict zones. As a result, parties to conﬂict and mediators speak different languages.

What the future holds
There are two main issues in the future prospects of the crisis and Ukrainian– Russian relations. One issue is possible scenarios for conﬂict resolution, and the second issue relates explicitly to the role Russia will be able to play in Ukraine after the crisis. It is interesting that most of the current literature ‘made in Russia’ is not about the future of Ukrainian–Russian relations, but about the future of Russia–West relations, which demonstrates both the non-acceptance of Ukraine as a subject of international politics and ultimately the root of the of the conﬂict. In Ukrainian discourse, the issues mostly raised are about the future development of
the state itself, the evolution of its relations with the European Union while the crisis is not settled, as well as the future of Russian–Ukrainian relations both on state and society levels after the conﬂict. Therefore, when the questions are set differently, it becomes more difﬁcult to ﬁnd common ground. As Gustav Gressel wrote (2015) ‘The confrontation between liberal Europe and Eurasist Russia is not going to be a short-term affair, and it neither began nor will it end with the conﬂict in Ukraine’.
The crisis of trust has reached its highest levels. With regular violations of the ceaseﬁre, an inextinguishable supply of weapons, the still-open Russian–Ukrainian border and Moscow’s denial of any responsibility, Russia is not seen any more in Ukraine as a reliable partner or counterpart at the negotiation table. Ukrainian attempts to attract and secure the presence of international actors in the conﬂict resolution process are motivated by two reasons. The ﬁrst is to have a witness, a guarantor or a deterrent for more aggressive Russian behaviour. Second, it

198

H. Shelest

constitutes an attempt to enhance shared responsibility for European security,
persuading European partners that only by solving the Ukrainian crisis can Europe
prevent further infringements. The paradox that exists here is that the West still prefers viewing the crisis as a purely Russian–Ukrainian conﬂict, while Russia sees it as Russian–West one.
In this situation, while the European Union at least took a mediation role, most Black Sea countries remained neutral. The low proﬁle of Turkish involvement despite the violation of the rights of Crimean Tatars has raised questions in
Ukrainian society. And while the passive reaction of Armenia and Azerbaijan could be expected due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conﬂict, human rights concerns and complicated relations with Russia, so Georgia’s ambiguous position also raised questions, as Tbilisi on the one hand, clearly condemned Crimean annexation, but
on the other hand, did not impose economic sanctions against Moscow. As a result,
the only Black Sea state on whose support Ukraine can still rely is Romania, which
in the past was actually perceived as a counterpart, as there were concerns of
possible Romanian territorial claims in Ukraine.
Russia does not necessarily need to seize more territory, but its aim seems to be preventing Ukraine from stabilizing. By freezing the conﬂict – and maintaining the potential for it to reignite quickly – Russia can ensure that investors shun Ukraine, that the government is distracted from other endeavours and that informal military forces retain their strength at the expense of the Ukrainian state (D’Anieri 2015, 239). Destabilization is thus attempted in several spheres – economic, energy, security and social. A renewed wave of active ﬁghting is possible, but probably will be conﬁned to the administrative borders of Donetsk and Lugansk regions. The annexation of Crimea has taught a lesson to Kiev and has obliged it to respond to aggression and remain on the defensive. Kiev’s concern is that unless military resistance is put against Russian aggression, another incursion will happen.
Ukraine had been at the centre of what Stalin called ‘internal colonization’ (Snyder 2014), a policy still followed by Russia. Russia places Ukraine at the heart of its sphere of inﬂuence and considers it as an important element of its own integration processes, a factor, which guarantees the consolidation of Russian soci-
ety and which rests on a thesis of shared history and shared historical memory (Гyщин and Mapкeдoнoв 2014). Putin’s own justiﬁcations of the seizure of Crimea repeatedly emphasize the need to protect Ukraine’s Russian and Russian-speaking population from the ‘fascist junta’ in Kiev and to bring historically Russian, ‘sacred’ territory back into the fold (Motyl 2015). Such an approach makes negotiations difﬁcult as it shifts the material conﬂict to an ideological basis. It is, thus, not about Russia’s economic losses from the Association Agreement any more, but about taking back what once belonged to Moscow even if with disputable rights.
Another misconception among Russian experts is that today’s mainstream attitude in Ukraine claims ‘Ukraine for Ukrainians based on civilian nationalism and readiness to sacriﬁce territorial integrity in order to consolidate other parts of the country and to force disloyal population and regions out of Ukraine’ (Cyшeнцoв 2015). This misperception demonstrates an inability to comprehend that competi-
tion along political lines and ideologies in Ukraine may lead to political crisis, but
does not mean the disintegration of the country. Moreover, the long history of
Ukraine, during which some of its parts were separated and incorporated in differ-
ent Empires and states, has produced high levels of tolerance and generated
admissibility of diversity. Moreover, Ukraine for Ukrainians has never been a

Southeast European and Black Sea Studies

199

political slogan in Ukraine, not even for nationalist parties, which Moscow is using to frighten western countries.
The manipulative position of many Russian experts is concentrated in the following statement: ‘Thus in exchange for sanctions’ suspension and taking away from the agenda the topic of Crimea, Russia will agree on the territorial integrity of Ukraine under condition of wide decentralization, probably with elements of the federal state … ’ (Гyщин and Mapкeдoнoв 2014). So, following the logic of the Russian leadership, the Russian Federation is not a part of the conﬂict in Ukraine; however, it will follow the basic principles of international law – territorial integrity of the states – only in case this state and others will agree to change its internal organization and reject part of its territory.
Also, ‘freezing’ the conﬂict is considered by Russian experts a good option that allows it to control the situation without spending much money in support of the separatists’ regions. At the same time for Ukraine ‘freezing’ the conﬂict is the worst scenario. The examples of protracted conﬂicts in Transnistria and Georgian regions are quite vivid and indicative of the negative implications, i.e. greater Russian political involvement in the breakaway regions and their further detachment from the central, legal government.
More and more parallels steadily appear in the discourse on the future of the separatists’ regions in Ukraine, comparing them with Transnistria and Abkhazia. There is a common perception that maintaining the conﬂicts unresolved would give Russia leverage on Ukraine and its future, especially with regard to its foreign policy orientation. However, as Vadim Dubnov writes ‘Separatists have not become a lever of pressure to Moldova and Georgia, because their mother states have managed to live quite well without those who separated’ (Дyбнoв 2014). Both Georgia and Moldova signed Association Agreements with the European Union and strive for future EU membership. In the case of Moldova, the visa-free regime has been introduced despite the uncertainty of borders with Transnistria. So, it should not be expected that the current crisis will stop Ukraine’s aspirations for closer cooperation with the European Union.
When discussing Russia’s role or its place in Ukraine, the question should be divided into parts. Economic links between the two sides may be restored but it cannot be business as usual. The re-orientation of Ukrainian business towards the EU market, as a result of the current crisis and the implementation of the Association Agreements, will be inevitable. Still, the Russian market will be interesting for Ukraine, as well as cooperation in ﬁelds such as energy, transport and rocketbuilding. Evidence to the strong economic linkages between the two countries is the inability to cut energy supply from Russia and its long-term hesitation to apply economic sanctions on Moscow while demanding such an action to be taken by the EU.
At the same time, cooperation in the military and security spheres will deﬁnitely be limited. Such cooperation can be expected only in ﬁghting terrorism and organized crime, selling military equipment such as missiles and their spare parts, cooperation in the framework of international organizations and conﬂict-prevention missions, like in Transnistria. All other spheres, including intelligence and joint training, might be restricted.
The arguments of Russian experts that Ukraine should become neutral again and reject NATO membership plans as a prerequisite for the resolution of the crisis and the reconciliation of both sides are beneath criticism. Four years of non-bloc/ neutral status of Kiev did not prevent the current crisis occurring nor stop Russian

military involvement in Ukraine; thus, there are no guarantees that new concessions
will be a safety-stop. Furthermore, in the same way that Poland was not asked to remain ‘neutral’ and become a buffer zone in the early 1990s, it should not be expected that Ukraine, the biggest European state, would undertake such a role
submitting to the will of a neighbouring state.
As history shows, even those states which fought for centuries can manage not only to ﬁnd peace but also to establish a constructive relationship, as Germany and France. The creation of the European Union was deﬁnitely one of the factors for such success. That is why despite all contradictions and ﬁghting, there is always a chance for normalization of Russian–Ukrainian relations. The question is how quickly this will happen and on what conditions. As both states are not ready to sacriﬁce their fundamental principles – the right to freely devise national policy versus securing spheres of inﬂuence – it will be difﬁcult to expect a quick solution to the Ukrainian–Russian conﬂict.

Russia’s Middle East Policy
This extraordinary book charts the development of Russia’s relations with the Middle East from the Russian Revolution of 1917 to the present. It covers both high and low points – the closeness to Nasser’s Egypt, followed by reversal; the successful invasion of Afghanistan which later turned into a disaster; the changing relationship with Israel which was at some time surprisingly close; the relationship with Syria, which continues to be of huge significance; and much more. Written by one of Russia’s leading Arabists who was himself involved in the formation and implementation of policy, the book is engagingly written, extremely insightful, telling us things which only the author is in a position to tell us, and remarkably frank, not sparing senior Soviet and Russian figures from criticism. The book includes material based on the author’s conversations with other leading participants.
Alexey Vasiliev is a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Honorary President of the Academy’s Institute for African Studies. He has been a close observer of and active participant in the Soviet Union’s and Russia’s relations with the Middle East for several decades.

Introduction
The year is 1969. We are in Arabia, in Dhufar, a south-western province of the Sultanate of Oman. This is the farthest point of the Arab world, the end of Eurasia, thousands of kilometres away from Moscow. We are in a hut, covered with palm branches. Cow hides are spread on the ground and sacks of grain hang from the cross beams as a precaution against rats. A woman, her face unveiled and with a large ring in her nose, brings us supper of boiled rice, dried fish and tea. Armed mountaindwellers are jammed into the hut. It is difficult to breathe. These people have come here to look at us, two Russians, Soviet men. We are guests of the People’s Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Zone of the Arabian Gulf,1 and we represent the Soviet Committee for Solidarity with the Countries of Asia and Africa. One of us is a journalist from Pravda, the other is a military intelligence officer. Our job is to see and understand what kind of organization this People’s Front is, whether it is genuine or merely a fiction, and then to recommend to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) what to do.
But now attention is no longer focused on us but is directed towards an Omani of African origin, a slave’s son from Salalah. He speaks freely and passionately, lines of poetry following political slogans. His words appeal both to reason and to the heart. I listen attentively . . .
“We are bogged down in the swamp of ignorance with our faces buried in the mire, in our fields and our shops we tremble with fear, as we try to save our skins. The sultans and the sheikhs are selling us to the imperialists. They live in palaces with air-conditioning – these are machines that give cold air even when it is hot”. The audience click their tongues in admiration. “And what falls to our lot,” he continues,
is mud, work performed by the sweat of our brow, and humiliation. But we are not slaves, and we have risen in rebellion. Our future is bright, the future when nobody will live at the expense of others and power will belong to the people. Our children will go to school. Doctors will come to our huts. Our oil will help the people to prosper. We shall follow along the road pointed out to us by the October revolution in Russia, discovered by the great Lenin.
I leave the hut. It is a warm Arabian night, with large low hanging stars and a full moon. It is absolutely quiet apart from an occasional roaring growl from the

camels lying nearby. A young soldier is sleeping in the shadow of a rock, his arms round his sub-machine-gun.
I don’t know whether to be happy or sad about what I have seen, heard and learned here. I am no longer, as I was in the greenness of my youth, a romantically minded Komsomol member ready to serve the cause of “the coming triumph of communism” around the globe.
Sharper and more bitter questions come into my mind. Why do communist ideas strike root in the most backward areas of our planet (here, for instance, and in Laos which I had recently visited)? and why do they have to be imposed by tanks in developed countries like Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany? What do we need here, and in the Near and Middle East more generally? Is it oil? But at this time it seems – though it does not seem so any longer! – that we have enough oil of our own to drown in. Or is it our economic position? But we have nothing to trade with. Are we to drive away the local sheikhs and kings? But do they disturb us at all? Shall we benefit or lose from the spread of communism? But who are “we”? The Soviet Union? Russia? The Party’s top leaders? The Russian intelligentsia? A Siberian miner or an ordinary peasant? Obviously “we”, i.e. the people of our country/do not need any British or American military pilots flying around the skies of Arabia because with their A-bombs they can reach us as well . . . And what about all the other things?
The year was 1969, and Soviet influence in the Middle East was reaching its peak. There were very few who could have foreseen that the descent would be so fast. Even so there were Soviet Middle Eastern experts who questioned the goals and the ways and means of implementing Soviet policy in the region, who queried whether these are compatible with or run counter to the national interests of the USSR, who asked what is understood by the term “the national interests” and what is the balance of home-and-foreign-policy. They asked who made decisions and how, once made, these decisions were implemented, and they wondered how we were perceived in the West, in the Arab countries, in Turkey, Iran or Afghanistan . . .
Much water had flowed under the bridges of the Volga and the Nile since that time, and many barkhans had been shifted by the winds to the Rub‘ al-Khali before the 1990s, when the author started to work on his book Russian Policy in the Middle East: from Messianism to Pragmatism. The USSR no longer exited. The time has come to set down honestly and clearly my observations and speculations, facts, documents and interviews.
Following the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, a question arose: what is the country whose foreign policy we are dealing with when we speak about the past and the future? It is Russian policy. We should not delude ourselves. In the past the Soviet Union was Russia with the countries and peoples that joined with her, or that were joined to her, during the course of history. The Soviet Union’s foreign policy was Russian foreign policy in the specific “Soviet dress”. This is why, when the words “the Soviet Union”, or “the USSR” are used in the text, the author means Russia with the Soviet political system.
The author’s main field of interest embraced and still embraces the Arab countries. However, the position and role of the Arab countries in Soviet foreign policy

Introduction 3
cannot properly be described without at the very least including an outline of Soviet policy towards Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan, although, because of the extensive relations between the USSR and these three states, such an outline can only be sketchy, although it is more detailed in the second part of the book, which covers the post-Gorbachev period.
In addition it has turned out to be impossible to present the subject without studying the work of many Western analysts – of many but by no means all because it would be unreasonable to claim that one could embrace everything that has been published.
In the years of the Soviet Union the interest in the Near and Middle East was so great that dozens of books on Soviet policy in the region were published. Western scholars were also quite familiar with Soviet sources and literature. Moreover Western sources pertinent to the same events are fuller and more explicit than Soviet ones. For instance, I have never found any information in the Soviet literature about the USSR’s airborne troops being on alert and the American troops being placed on nuclear alert during the Arab-Israeli war of 1973. However, neither Soviet nor Western authors – whatever the merits of the latter – manage to avoid the “ideologization” of their studies. They use the “zero-sum game” approach, so whenever the Soviet Union won, it meant that the United States lost – and vice versa. Sometimes even facts were altered to fit the wording. After the collapse of the USSR the interest in the Russian policy in the region almost disappeared, and started to revive again only in the early 21st century. The remaining indoctrination and their own messianic spirit stained the work of most Western authors, although there were exceptions, to which the reader will find references in the text.
The author’s task, which he set in the 1990s, was rather complicated and ambitious but even if it only partly succeeded, it was hoped that new light would be shed on Soviet policy in the Near and Middle East. The main idea was to try to find various levels or bands of reality, or at least to take these bands into account in the analysis. The first band was the socio-political situation in the Near and Middle East in which Soviet foreign policy departments acted. The second band had its own laws of operation and included Soviet bureaucratic structures which determined foreign policy on the basis of a certain ideological order (at least this was so in the past). The third band was less researched, and included individuals who participated in decision-making or in realizing a certain foreign policy line; i.e., people who were competent or ignorant, clever or silly, who had their convictions or prejudices, interests and illusions, and who were courageous or cowardly. It is obvious that the fourth level was the author himself who, as decreed by Fate, had dedicated his life to studying the region, who had been an eyewitness to, and on rare occasions a participant in certain events. Thus his position, his way of thinking, his experience, knowledge and possibly his prejudices, were all to be found in the book.
Like any historian, the author has dealt with the records or historical testimonies of politics – i.e. documents, declarations, statements, speeches, protocols and agreements. However, much is still inaccessible, and the archives of the main foreign policy departments are still closed to research. The author therefore

interviewed figures from the past epoch as well as individuals who are still working and who agreed to talk to him.
This quest for material and Middle East policy makers led me to a modest two-roomed flat near Sokol metro station where 86-year-old D. T. Shepilov lived. He was the person who handed over the famous nuclear missile ultimatum to the ambassadors of Great Britain, France and Israel on 5th November 1956, and his chances of becoming the leader of the Soviet Union were good, although he failed to achieve this. Perhaps it was the last interview of his life.
I also visited a humble mansion in Elizarova Street near Kursky railway and metro stations, which was occupied by the Foreign Policy Association and where I interviewed the Association’s president, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze. The former Soviet foreign minister became doubly famous when he resigned his post in December 1990, after a sensational prediction of an impending rightist coup. In 1992 he became the head of the Republic of Georgia after it had declared its independence.
There was also an interview with A. S. Dzasokhov who was for many years the de facto head of the Soviet Solidarity Committee with the Countries of Asia and Africa and who later became the Soviet Ambassador to Syria. Before the 1991 coup he had been appointed chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the waning Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and became a member of the Political Bureau of the CPSU. Later he became President of North Ossetia, after that – a member of the Federal Assembly. The interview took place in the Solidarity Committee’s mansion in Prechistenka Street (former Kropotkinskaya Street).
Another meeting, held before the coup of August 1991, took place at the Central Committee’s offices in Staraya Square with the former alternate member of the Politbureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU, B. N. Ponomarev. Although he had been removed from the Central Committee, he was unable to part company with the organization, and was still sitting in one of the empty rooms (of which there were many even before August 1991), sorting through papers which nobody needed and gathering materials for a text book on the history of the CPSU which nobody needed either. He was the only individual who refused to let me use a tape recorder or to make notes during our talk, so our rather scanty conversation had to be written down from memory when I had returned home.
I had a more detailed interview with Mr Ponomarev’s deputy, R. A. Ulyanovsky, with whom I was well acquainted, at his three-roomed flat in fashionable Alexander Tolstoy Street (modern Spiridonovka Street). Among all those who had been subjected to reprisals in the 1930s and later rehabilitated, he was the only one after 1956 who rose to relative prominence, becoming deputy head of the International Department of the CPSU Central Committee. A humanely attractive person, throughout his life he had been a believer in myths, had spoken in their defence, had propagated and, in part, created them. At the time he looked on in utter bewilderment at the ruins of the structure that had seemed so indestructible.
Many of the former representatives of the top echelon of the Soviet elite are now living in an apartment block in Stanislavsky Street. In one of the flats I had a conversation with N. G. Egorychev, who was the secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee in the 1970s. He had been a rising political star and also a potential Soviet leader but had suffered defeat after colliding with L. I. Brezhnev. But,

Introduction 5
in contrast to the days of Stalin when political opponents were exterminated, Egorychev was “sentenced” to ambassadorial exile in Denmark, and later, under the new leadership of Gorbachev, he was appointed as ambassador to Afghanistan, during the withdrawal of the Soviet troops.
Rather large numbers of ambassadors, other diplomats and functionaries of the former International Department of the CPSU Central Committee, as well as staff members of the main Military Intelligence Department of the Soviet Defence Ministry, the First Main Directorate (PGU) of the State Security Committee (KGB) (the predecessor of the modern Foreign Intelligence Service) and foreign economy departments agreed to meet and talk to me. Some did not want their names mentioned, and most of the others who were still working preferred to remain anonymous. Thus the majority of those with whom I spoke asked that their names should not be mentioned in this book – which to an extent diminishes its value. The author states categorically that when he quoted his anonymous interlocutors, he preserved the meaning of what they had said, added nothing, and often believed them to be a more reliable source than those who spoke in their own names.
The quality and reliability of the work have been ensured with the help of two former students of the author, who had earned their PhDs, – Irina Abramova and Oleg Levin. The first became a prominent researcher and an organizer of science, and in 2015 replaced the author as Director of the Institute for African Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The second became a senior diplomat and in 2015 was appointed Russia’s envoy to Jordan.
Nearly a quarter century has passed, and this new edition of the book From Lenin to Putin covers a hundred years and includes the post-Gorbachev period. The previous content has received an update, although the fundamental assessments have remained the same. The post-Gorbachev period is covered in the second part of the book – The limits of Pragmatism. Frequent trips to countries of the region and meetings with Western colleagues have allowed the author to keep abreast of the situation throughout the years. Therefore, the author decided to add some new experiences to the Introduction.
We are now in Washington. It is January 2011. A group of Russian Orientalists are meeting with their American counterparts. TV programs are focused on the “super show” – the Arab revolutions. An American correspondent with perfect articulation reports from the bustling Tahrir Square in Cairo: “The protesters do not express any anti-American feelings”. Behind him a poster says in Arabic “Irhal-irhal ya gabban ya amil al-american” (“Leave, a coward and an American agent!” (a reference to President Mubarak). All Russian participants speak of the expected growth of Islamist tendencies in the Arab world. The American colleagues keep silent.
Tahrir Square. Cairo. February 2011. Mubarak has relinquished power. Gamal El-Ghitany (now deceased), a prominent Arab writer, perhaps the best in the Arab world, does not conceal his emotions:
About a week before January 25, I was at the presidential palace at a reception – someone was being awarded the highest state honour – the Order

of the Nile. I was feeling depressed. I saw a royal court, with footmen, ceremonies, liars, sycophants. Everything seemed dead and hopeless. “Will it last for years?” – I asked myself. Of course, on January 24 I had heard that the next day youth would be organizing a demonstration with the help of the Internet. But as a person of an older generation, I just could not believe in the success of the Internet. But then it happened! Alexei! Finally! The revolution united all Muslims and Copts, rich and poor, intellectuals and illiterate. It was a nationwide rush. Let there be difficulties, suffering and victims! But the old, dead regime would not come back!
“My dear friend! My faithful, honest, infinitely talented friend. I so want to believe you! I so want to believe in the future of Egypt which I love so much. But I am from the country, which over the past century has been through so many revolutions and counter-revolutions! And how bitterly I look at the current situation in my country” . . . I did not say these words, so as not to hurt him.
Tahrir Square itself has become the brand name of the Egyptian revolution, a symbol of steadfastness, courage, freedom. For 18 days without a break passions were seething here; speeches, debates, poetry readings and songs were made, there were clashes with police, thugs hired by police, and even camel cavalry. Millions shouted the same word against President Mubarak, “Leave!!!”. And then police disappeared. In the square and side streets stood tanks, but the army did not intervene in the events. President Mubarak left. So what happened next? Next came difficult times for Egypt.
I asked myself the old question: “What do we, that is Russia, want here?” It begged an answer: “Do not interfere! In Egyptian and Arab affairs in general”.
At that we haven’t succeeded. In the 21st century Russia is eager to return to the Middle East. So happened that Syria has become the gateway. Damascus. April 2016. I am speaking to the Russian ambassador Alexander Alexandrovich Kinschak in his office. Distant bursts of heavy guns are occasionally heard. “They are pounding targets in the suburbs of Damascus, about five–seven kilometres away”, Alexander explains. “Those quarters are under the control of insurgents – ISIS or Jabhat al-Nusra. They shoot only at the areas with no local residents. Militants took refuge in the tunnels under the ground. These territories and the remaining inhabited quarters are blocked by the army”. “Can I get to the front line positions?” “No, I am responsible for your safety. And in the city, you have to ride only our car, it is armoured and reliable”. On the Syrian-Lebanese border I was greeted by two cars with Russian special forces in black uniforms, with guns and cordless phones. I was taken to a hotel in the centre of Damascus, and then just one car without an escort brought me to the embassy, which was protected by Russian guards inside and Syrian guards outside. The access road led between high concrete walls. An overpass near the embassy was closed to traffic. I rode the same car around the city, to meetings and to the University. Well, orders are orders, but curiosity took over. I took a taxi and for a small baksheesh its driver showed me the bus station from which you could get to the

ISIS “capital” Raqqa (that is, across the front lines of the Civil War), crowded cafeterias, noisy streets of the old town, and then he drove to the positions of the Syrian army that blocked the approaches to the former Palestinian camp of Yarmouk. The camp had no tents, but was just another poor neighbourhood of Greater Damascus. After the clashes between the two Islamist organizations, part of the Yarmuk was controlled by ISIS and another part by Jabhat al-Nusra, while some neighbourhoods were completely deserted, with militants hiding in underground tunnels.
A young officer examined my Russian passport after hearing the request, and after lengthy conversations and phone calls to somewhere agreed to take me to an observation post. “Not a single step without my permission, there are snipers on the other side”. “Hadyr (I agree)”, I replied. We followed a deep trench to a deserted house, where you could look over a concrete wall through a periscope and see the zone controlled by the militants: a deserted square surrounded by dilapidated buildings, skeletons of destroyed cars. “We observe, and if we notice any movement, we transmit the coordinates to the artillery, and they hit the targets”. I was not allowed to stay. In parting, the officer reiterated his gratitude to Russia, repeating what President Bashar al-Assad said in a recent speech almost word for word. Political education in the army was well established.
My visit to Syria, where Russia demonstrated its military capabilities for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, has left a lot of questions unanswered, both with regard to this country and to the region of the Middle East. I will try to answer some of them in the second part of the book titled The Limits of Pragmatism.
However, stepping away from the chronology, I will recite my visit to the United Arab Emirates in December 2015. The Dhufar revolutionaries were going to “liberate” this very country together with Oman to build a “happy socialist society”.
We are in Arabia, in Dubai. December 2015. A lift silently takes me to the 161st floor of the world’s tallest skyscraper Burj Khalifa. In total it has 200 floors and is 828 meters of height. From the observation deck one can admire the crowd of “short” 60–70-floor skyscrapers, multilevel interchanges of motorways; further to the east is the sea, to the west – the desert. There were miserable mud huts of fishermen and Bedouin tents when I was the first Soviet and perhaps the first Russian in the history to visit the United Arab Emirates in 1969 – immediately after independence.
In Burj Khalifa you can travel from one floor to another: it is probably the world’s first vertical city, able to accommodate 35,000 people. There are apartments, hotels, offices, restaurants, shops, various consumer services. At the sunset you can descend to the lower terrace of the hotel and admire fountains dancing to jazz or Arab music above an artificial lake turning pink. Or you can walk along the endless rows of department stores, shops and boutiques. Or have a cup of coffee while looking through Russian-language magazines or thick local newspapers in Arabic or English. At your hotel room in the evening you can choose from hundreds of TV channels. You will drown in the ocean of information (or

8 Introduction
disinformation) provided by print and electronic media and will be stupefied by advertisings of cars, jewellery, shoes, watches, perfumes, art exhibitions, concerts and tours – all that can be sold.
At my age one cannot be like a 17-year-old romantic, but the soul still protests when you see an advertisement of a dinner for two somewhere across the world with a price tag of $600,000 dollars. You pay and you get an “all inclusive”: a flight for two by first-class or even by a special flight to the edge of the world, a commensurate hotel suite, drinks and meals. Yet nearby, in neighbouring Yemen, in miserable huts people are lucky to have some grain in small bags hung on ropes to save them from rats. They often do not have enough food and water, and their children, plastered with flies, often go to bed hungry.
Here is a message about a hockey match between Emirates’ Russian and Swedish teams. In the trunk of the car of a young employee of the Russian Consulate General I saw boots with skates. He explained: all year round he played hockey on the team of the Russian diaspora; their competitors were a dozen other teams. Ice rinks allow for training and games even in 45–48 degree heat. Well, in the Emirates you can also find air-conditioned stops of the above-ground metro, and even snowy hills of a skiing slalom.
In 2014, 600,000 Russians visited the Emirates. They spent $1.2 billion. Somewhat fewer came in 2015. Tourists, ministers, businessmen. And not only them. In a restaurant of an expensive hotel men were having a good time and shouting something in Russian. A waiter whispered to me, “These are godfathers (in Russian – ‘authorities’) of Russian mafias. Nobody touches them here, and neither do they bother anyone – they are just very generous customers”.
In Sharjah, one of the seven Emirates, recently the five-domed Church of St. Philip the Apostle was erected and consecrated. Some come here to dip into the cool silence of the only Orthodox Church in Arabia, while other – to pray for forgiveness and repent their sins.
Just now in the UAE there took place a military exhibition and sale Dubai Airshow 2015. Russia was represented by 23 companies, which demonstrated more than 200 designs of modern military equipment – from multi-role fighters to surveillance and communication systems. It was not just sales: Rostec corporation set up a joint venture with Emirati Tawazun Holding for the production of ammunition, including for BMP-3 combat vehicles.
In the UAE, I was a participant of an international conference on security in the Persian (Arabian) Gulf, organized by the Abu Dhabi Centre for Strategic Studies. The Centre has more than 300 employees of various nationalities. Their works are serious. They cover the most topical issues of security, economy, social affairs and religion. Director of the Centre Jamal Sanad Al-Suwaidi presented me with his book From a Tribe to Facebook: the Role of Social Networks in the Transformation of Society.
The Emirates, just like neighbouring Kuwait and Qatar, is unique: few indigenous people possess enormous oil and gas wealth. Traditional leaders have been able to use them efficiently. For this, they have attracted elite and low-skilled foreign labour, which in the UAE constitutes 10 times the number of local residents.

Introduction 9
Though that is not the point. The main question to ask is what does Russia need here? The answer is surprisingly simple: mutually beneficial trade, arms deliveries, joint economic projects, attraction of investment from the United Arab Emirates to Russia, tourism. No ideology. Of course, Russia is interested in stability in the Gulf region, although its parameters require special consideration.
Working on this – the second – part of the book, I realized that many secrets and decision-making mechanisms of post-Gorbachev period still remain a “sealed book”. Less information is available on them in comparison to the preceding period, which has been discussed quite frankly by many former Soviet leaders. The contemporary diplomats and intelligence are much more reserved even on condition of anonymity.
Therefore, I cannot fail to note with gratitude the conversations that were informative and helped to understand many things. My meetings with Yevgeny Maximovich Primakov took place at the building of the Chamber of Commerce or in the office at the World Trade Centre Moscow. He was my former colleague in Pravda newspaper, academician, political scientist, economist, journalist, and then he successively held the posts of Head of Intelligence, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation. After B. N. Yeltsin, incited by the “family” and oligarchs, dismissed him, Y. M. Primakov for many years served as president of the Chamber of Commerce. At his 80th anniversary, where the author found himself in a “narrow circle” of about 200 guests, V. V. Putin called him a “great citizen”. Further, he said the following, “In the years when Russia was on the brink of the abyss, there were such Primakovs to lead her away from the edge”. Then they together sang a song about Leningrad “City on a fast river . . .”
I have gained a lot from the interviews with I. S. Ivanov, former Foreign Minister and Secretary of the Russian Security Council. We met in Malaya Yakimanka Street, in the office of the Russian Council on International Affairs, which he had founded.
The role of energy in the foreign policy of the Russian Federation was elaborated to me by a former Minister of Fuel and Energy, current chairman of the Russian Union of Oil and Gas Producers, Y. K. Shafranik.
Another person who openly spoke to me was A. S. Kulik, former head of Soviet intelligence in the Middle East. Upon his retirement, he retained a fresh mind, beliefs and even connections, but was already seriously ill. He was a rare breed of ascetic person – he remained in his “Khrushchyovka” apartment on principle, not moving into something more comfortable and prestigious, fitting Major-General of the First Chief Directorate of the KGB.
My old good friend Sheikh Ravil Gainutdin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the European part of Russia, Chairman of the Council of Muftis of Russia, did not refuse to meet me in his office across from a gorgeous building – the Cathedral Mosque of Moscow. Like a symbol of our Russian hopes for the cooperation and solidarity of all citizens of Russia, nearby there are Orthodox churches, an Armenian Cathedral and Olympic Stadium. Only a synagogue and a Buddhist temple are lacking.

10 Introduction
The subchapters on the pre-2011 Russian-Egyptian relations were written on the basis of the dissertation of M. L. Bogdanov, Deputy Foreign Minister, former Ambassador to Israel and Egypt, which the author had the privilege to supervise. Mr. Bogdanov gave me a special interview, covering the Russian Middle East policy after the “Arab Spring”.
Details of the Russian policy in Syria, especially in connection with the involvement of the Russian Aerospace Forces in the civil war, were shared with the author by academician V. V. Naumkin, who was a senior advisor to the United Nations special envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura.
With his interviews P. V. Stegniy practically co-authored a number of subchapters. A former Russian Ambassador to Kuwait, Turkey, Israel, historian, brilliant writer, he was the anonymous “diplomat” from the first part of the book, where most of the interviews belonged to him.
My old colleague from Pravda newspaper, then an employee of Asia and Africa today journal, Colonel of the First Chief Directorate of KGB E. M. Rusakov agreed not only to go through the first part of the book as an editor, but also to give an interview on his own behalf, which helped to look at events from an “American angle”.
My colleagues – Orientalists A. V. Korotaev, L. M. Isaev, A. A. Tkachenko, N. A. Filin, L. M. Ravandi-Fadai, A. S. Hodunov and former Russian Consul General in Istanbul L. I. Manzhosin – participated in the discussion of individual episodes in the book and supplied the author with facts and events. A lot of editing work on the second part of the book was done by O. I. Teterin, the author’s deputy for Asia and Africa today journal.
At the beginning a huge factual material was collected by the author’s assistant S. A. Chukanov. He also maintained active correspondence in English, Russian and Arabic. No word of thanks is enough to appreciate his work, interrupted by death as a result of serious illness.
The translation into English was made by S. V. Kostelyanets, who was also tasked with fact checking. The translation into Arabic was verified by graduate student K. V. Meshcherina. Indeed, the book would have never come to light without the dedicated work of the author’s permanent assistant S. V. Polunina, who was the only person to be able to make out the author’s scribbles and quick dictation.
Thus, the book can be considered a collective work. However, while its merits the author certainly shares with those he interviewed, his colleagues and assistants, all flaws and irregularities are exclusively on the conscience of the author.

The Bolshevik slogan of the October 1917 revolution was “Down with . . .!” Relying on the enormous potential for negativity that was present in all their slogans and programmes the Bolsheviks denounced the war, which had cost around two million Russian lives, and the privileges of the Russian nobility and even their right to exist (most of the cultivated land having formerly belonged to them). They also denounced the old Tsarist autocracy that had deprived the majority of the population of their democratic rights (including the Russian bourgeoisie which had not yet managed to devise forms of coexistence and cooperation with the workers), as well as the imperial system of relations between nations and peoples, and the fragile quasi-democratic government.
These extreme and radical slogans, uttered in extreme circumstances, appealed to reason and to the heart. Bolshevik propaganda and agitation made people dizzy: “Peace for the people, land for the peasants, bread for the hungry, factories for the workers!” The Declaration of Rights of the Peoples of Russia, adopted on 2 November 1917, proclaimed
1 The equality and sovereignty of the peoples of Russia; 2 The right of the peoples of Russia to free self-determination up to and includ-
ing secession and formation of independent states; 3 The abolition of all national and national-religious privileges and restrictions; 4 The free development of the national minorities and ethnographical (i.e.,
ethnic – A.V.) groups inhabiting the territory of Russia.1
None of the points in the Declaration remained inviolate during the Soviet years. Yet there is no question as to the attractiveness of the document both inside and outside the country during those revolutionary days. The same tone characterized the appeal addressed “To All the Working Muslims of Russia and the East”, adopted on 20 December 1917 and signed by V. I. Lenin. The document said that the Arabs as well as all Muslims had the right to be the masters of their country and to decide their own destiny as they wished.2
As to the exhausted and embittered population, the Bolsheviks brought them a messianic concept of salvation, of God’s kingdom on earth, with a new, previously unknown and mysterious name – “socialism” or “communism”. An ideal

12 Sources of Messianism and pragmatism
society of freedom, equality, justice, well-being and love was at hand. One had simply to follow the Bolsheviks and trust them. A total rejection of the old – power, property, law, morals and religion – allowed for everything to be razed to the ground by all possible means. The earlier civilization, and indeed human lives themselves, were regarded at best as the materials for building a wall that would surround a beautiful sweet-smelling communist-society garden, and at worst as a fertiliser for that garden. But although none of these “professional revolutionaries” – i.e. the destroyers (who were quite skilful destroyers, as was discovered subsequently) – ever knew what kind of new society they were going to build and how it was going to be done, decades of stability enabled them to prove new and unprecedented forms of statehood and party dictatorship, as well as their own tenacious self-preservation and self-reproduction, and their ability to find themselves a social base first in the working class and then among the lumpenproletariat (or the “marginals” as they are now called in the Third World).
The entire multi-layered and far-reaching propaganda network with the new messianic idea at its core, together with the apparatus for reprisals, became a necessary and integral part of the system. Communist ideology, from Marxist-Leninist theory to newspaper and radio propaganda, not only held particular blocks of the system in place but also bound together people who needed a new religion and a new faith by whose lofty ideals they could justify their own or other people’s behaviour as well as their own or other people’s sufferings and even crimes.
These ideals, or rather the magic of sounds and words, charmed several generations of Soviet people and particularly captivated the new intelligentsia and leftwing intellectuals in the West and the ‘fighters for national liberation’ in the East. “The manifestos of the newly-born state were quite new for humanity”, wrote the Egyptian historian al-Shafii many years later.
“Peace among nations! Workers of all lands, unite! Colonial peoples, free yourselves! We render moral and material support to all who wish to be free . . .” For the first time in history a great power appeared which did not wish to colonise, occupy or exploit anyone but which sided with the forces of liberation around the world. This new state offered to help Saad Zaghlul with arms but he took fright and refused.3
Indeed local organizations that actually used the Russian term “Soviets” appeared during the period of revolutionary development in Egypt in 1919.
The ideals that were propagated were separate from the realities of Soviet society but this was of little concern to the proponents of socialism in the West or the “fighters for national liberation” in the East. First, the majority of “friends of the USSR” simply did not know the truth; they were fed either with propaganda or with specially selected information, either genuine or forged. Second, they did not want to know the truth because they only needed ideas, slogans and “examples” to reinforce their own political behaviour or attitudes. Third, from their point of view, the Russians and other nationalities of the USSR suffered for the sake of a brighter future for humanity, and in any case Messianic ideas demand sacrifices

Sources of Messianism and pragmatism 13
that are quite justifiable especially when they are not yours. Fourth, the main point was the USSR’s behaviour in the international arena, which was supported when it converged with the interests, goals and struggles both of the revolutionaries of all complexions in the West and the East and of the new political elites which came to power in certain countries.
The Bolsheviks who took power in Russia neither knew nor understood the East. The experience acquired by some of the leaders of the October Revolution who had worked in the Muslim areas of the Volga and the Transcaucasian regions proved to be an entirely inadequate basis for any serious analysis of situations, trends and socio-political developments in the East at the time. Mired in incompetence and dogmatism they attempted to adjust the highly complex realities of the Asian and African countries to fit Marxist slogans and “theories”. After the Revolution and until the 1990s most of the politically important studies by Soviet experts on the East were compiled from the research of Western scholars, larded with Marxist-Leninist phraseology.
Why did this not function as an obstacle to the long-term effectiveness of some Bolshevik slogans, taken separately or combined into a “scientific theory”? Social truths, like scientific or poetic discoveries, are perceived either by way of thorough analysis, research and synthesis of facts and comparison of arguments, or by way of a revelation, a sudden penetration into the heart of the problem and into the ways by which it can be solved. For the Bolsheviks their denouncement of the entire previous world order, including the colonial system and the political dependence of some countries upon others, was just such a revelation. From today’s vantage point it is all too easy to criticize Lenin’s theory of imperialism, and there are numerous arguments proving that the colonial system that was described in the writings of Hilferding and Hobson and on which Lenin based his ideas was actually a more complex phenomenon. But what is important is the political conclusion drawn from these premises: denouncement, and a call for destruction, i.e. for a revolutionary smashing of the world order according to which one nation deprives another of political independence or sharply limits it. From this we arrive at a practical conclusion: the recognition of the legality of and support for all forms of struggle against the colonial and semi-colonial systems, for national liberation, for the rights of nations to self-determination and for their political independence.
Irrespective of nuances, this approach meant that up to a certain point Lenin and his followers had been following a path which coincided with the advance of the historical process in the East, including the Near and Middle East. Their slogans had, fully or in part, served the political struggles of the leaders of the national liberation movement, especially of the most radical wing, and also of the people at large. It also meant that the leaders of Great Britain and France, having perceived their victory over Germany and its allies in World War I as a means of legitimizing their colonial empires in the Near and Middle East, were going against the stream of history, against the growing demands for political independence.
Before the revolution of October 1917 Lenin wrote that the duty of socialists was to support the struggle of oppressed peoples for their complete national

14 Sources of Messianism and pragmatism
emancipation “in whatever form, right down to an uprising or war”.4 It was only 40 years later that the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (hereafter CPSU) began to talk of preferring peaceful methods of struggle. In Lenin’s opinion Soviet Russia had to base its relations with the young states “on a complete break with the barbarous policy of bourgeois civilisation which has built up the prosperity of the exploiters, who belong to a few chosen nations, through the enslavement of hundreds of millions of working people in Asia, in colonies in general, and in small countries”.5 Thus the thesis had already been voiced about the need for an “alliance” between the “victorious proletariat” of the Soviet Russia (i.e. the Bolsheviks and their leadership), and the “oppressed peoples of the East” in their opposition to “imperialism” (i.e. the West).
Lenin was convinced that the ruling classes of Western Europe drew their wealth from the exploitation of their colonies, and since these classes were the main opponents of the Bolsheviks it was necessary to find some method of weakening their positions and, in particular, of depriving them of their colonies. It is curious that among 21 of the terms of admission in the Comintern elaborated by Lenin, there was one which said that a party willing to belong to the Third International “must ruthlessly expose the colonial machinations of the imperialists of its ‘own’ country, must support – in deed, not merely in word – every colonial liberation movement, must demand the expulsion of its compatriot imperialists from the colonies”.6 For Lenin, the attitude of every individual communist party to the national liberation movement was a major proof of its loyalty to the principles of “proletarian internationalism” – in other words, was proof of its devotion to Soviet Russia, or more precisely to the Bolshevik party which had captured power there, and even more precisely to its leadership.
The actual idea of a “hostile environment” was born during the years of civil war and foreign invasion. There were enemies on the other side of the frontier or of the front line, yet they had to be swept away by the proletarian revolution, i.e. by German, French and British Bolsheviks. The apocalyptic vision of the world as defined by the Soviet leadership was of an epoch of civil war that would be waged by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie in the advanced capitalist countries, combined with the national liberation movement of the oppressed nations: “the socialist revolution,” wrote Lenin, “will not be solely or chiefly a struggle of the revolutionary proletarians in each country against their bourgeoisie; no, it will be a struggle of all imperialist-oppressed colonies and countries, of all dependent countries against international imperialism”.7
The nationalist-liberation movement had, in the opinion of Soviet Russia’s leaders, to undermine the deepest foundations of imperialism so that, as a consequence, the latter would lose profitable spheres for the application of capital, huge human reserves, minerals, and strategically, important territories. Imperialism would be deprived of essential sources for the super-profits gained from exploiting its colonies, its foreign markets would shrink, and the possibility of bribing the upper crust of the working class in the metropolitan countries would decrease sharply; this would create favourable conditions for the struggle of the proletariat in the capitalist countries and would thus exacerbate class contradictions within

Sources of Messianism and pragmatism 15
them. Naturally, neither facts nor figures were quoted to confirm the supposed role of the West’s colonial periphery – but they were not required. The “victorious proletariat” of Soviet Russia needed an ally, and if it did not exist it had to be invented. When the reality was somehow incompatible with the concocted picture of the world or ran counter to certain tenets of Marxist theory – which in particular denounced nationalism in favour of “proletarian internationalism” – there were various explanations to hand. “The bourgeois nationalism of any oppressed nation”, remarked Lenin, “has a general democratic content that is directed against oppression and it is this content that we unconditionally support”.8
A certain feedback was presupposed and propagated: the successes of the national liberation movement depended on the successes of Soviet Russia and of the proletariat of the developed countries of the West. The contraposition of Soviet Russia to the West and of the Western proletariat to its own bourgeoisie created favourable conditions for the victory of the liberation struggle of oppressed nations, since it weakened the stature of imperialism, diminished its forces and limited its freedom of action in the colonial and semi-colonial periphery. As Lenin wrote at the time:
Now, as always, we stand and shall continue to stand for the closest association and merging of the class-conscious workers of the advanced countries with the workers, peasants and slaves of all the oppressed countries. We have always advised and shall continue to advise all the oppressed classes in all the oppressed countries, the colonies included, not to separate from us, but to form the closest possible ties and to merge with us.9
And in July 1920 he said that world imperialism would fall
when the revolutionary onslaught of the exploited and oppressed workers in each country . . . merges with the revolutionary onslaught of hundreds of millions of people who have hitherto stood beyond the pale of history.10
But until imperialism did collapse, “a policy must be pursued that will achieve the closest alliance of all the national and colonial liberation movements with Soviet Russia”,11 a proposal that was not lacking either in precision or in formal logic. The fact that the revolution in the West was rather late in taking place made it even more attractive. The leadership of the Bolshevik party assessed the possibilities in the East – maybe a mass movement would develop there that would ameliorate the situation for the Soviet government which, because of the policy of “war communism”, had been plunged into crisis and was encountering huge difficulties. With this aim in view, and taking into account the material resources available at the time, a really grand performance was staged, the herald of numerous future performances – the congresses of solidarity with the peoples of Asia and Africa during the 1950s to 1980s. “Representatives” from Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Arabia, Syria and Palestine were among the participants, though they represented only themselves or a few small groups of similarly-minded people. However, the

16 Sources of Messianism and pragmatism
apocalyptic tone of the manifesto addressed to the peoples of the East was compatible with both the irrational and the unfortunate timing of the assembling of the congress, and with the intellectual and cultural level of its participants. “You dogs, you cannot devour the peoples of the East! You, a miserable handful of oppressors, cannot turn millions of Eastern peasants and workers into your slaves for centuries to come”, declaimed the authors of the manifesto, addressing themselves to English capitalists and to the ruling circles of Great Britain. “You have snatched at too big a bite. It is not for your teeth, and you will be choked by it!” The manifesto ended with an appeal to the oppressed peoples of the East “to start a holy war for an independent life and happiness for all the peoples of the East, and for the many millions of its peasants and workers oppressed by Britain”.12
Lenin regarded the work of the Congress of the Peoples of the East highly, saying in a speech given on 15 October 1920:
That which was achieved by the Congress of Communists in Moscow (the 2nd Congress of the Comintern – A.V.) and the Baku Congress of Communist Representatives of Peoples of the East cannot be immediately assessed or directly calculated, but it has been an achievement of greater significance than some military victories are because it proves to us that the experience of the Bolsheviks, their activities and programme, and their call for a revolutionary struggle against the capitalists and the imperialists have won worldwide recognition; that which was achieved in Moscow in July and in Baku in September will for many months to come provide food for thought and assimilation by the workers and peasants of the world.13
A countless army of faithful Christians and the world’s Christian civilization grew out of a small group of Christ’s followers. The League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class gave birth to the Bolshevik Party, the CPSU, the Soviet Union and the worldwide “socialist system”. No such role was prepared for the Baku Congress. It was an act of propaganda, performed without any serious consequences. Bolshevism – Communism, Marxism-Leninism, “scientific socialism” – as a political theory, political practice or a political organization, did not strike root in the Arab countries or in Turkey and Iran. Several decades would pass before strong communist parties in Iraq and Sudan flowered briefly and died out, and before large-scale and tragic experiments took place at state level in South Yemen and Afghanistan. However, we will look in more detail later at the fate of the communist movement in the region.
The efforts aimed at destroying the old system of international relations included, among other things, a public “denouncing of secret diplomacy” and the publication of secret agreements extracted from the archives of Russia’s Diplomatic Department. An important example of the latter was the Sykes-Picot Agreement14 concerning the division of the Asian part of Turkey, concluded between Britain and France on 16 May 1916 in coordination with the Russian government. The Ottoman government was informed about the Agreement and the text was handed over to Sharif Hussein, leader of the Arab revolt against the Turks in the

Sources of Messianism and pragmatism 17
Hejaz. This did not alter either the course of the Arab revolt against the Turks or the plans for the division of the Middle East among the colonial powers, although it did embitter relations between the Sharif and the British. Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, remarked in his memoirs that publishing secret agreements that determined the destiny of Arab lands within the Ottoman empire “aroused strong indignation in Arab circles”.15
In the period between the two wars, there were few opportunities for the Soviet Union in the Middle East. Because Britain and France were too powerful and those who opposed them in the region were too immature and dispersed, the USSR was essentially unable to benefit from the main differences in the approaches towards the Middle East situation adopted by Moscow, London and Paris. However, as has repeatedly been the case throughout history, the pinnacle of power has meant the beginning of the end, and this has been so from the days of the Roman Empire to the recent disintegration of the “socialist community”. Great Britain and France in the Middle East were no exception, although the collapse of their empires and the temporary and limited triumph of the Soviet Union was to occur only after World War II. In the meantime the pragmatism of the USSR’s foreign policy in the Near and Middle East could clearly be discerned as the great power, having utterly denounced the old world order, began nevertheless to acquire some of the features of a state forced to co-exist with other states and obliged to submit to the rules of behaviour, drawn up long ago and modified only slightly since, that apply in the world arena. The contradictory unity of ideology and practice and of the messianic idea laid down in the founding of the Soviet State, as well as the genuine interests of this vast country, determined and explained the USSR’s actions as well as many of its successes and failures in the Near and Middle East.
In the Kremlin they understood rather quickly and rather well that the revolutionary potential of the West and the East on which so many hopes had been pinned had turned out to be illusory. The power of the party in individual countries had to be consolidated. In the world arena it was necessary to ensure the legitimization of their power and the security of their borders and to find allies. When it became clear that “communisation” or “Sovietisation” of the southern frontier countries – Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan – was out of the question, the Soviet government began, rapidly and with flexibility, to establish normal and even friendly inter-state relations with them. It was during this time that the model of the USSR’s relations with Third World countries was beginning to be tested. In Moscow they turned a blind eye to the domestic policies of these states, including the persecution of the “brothers-in-class” and the ideological communist allies, with the aim of consolidating the independence and neutrality of these countries and, at best, strengthening their confrontation with the West and securing their cooperation with the USSR.
The Soviet Union and Turkey found a common enemy in the Great Powers of the Entente who had not only divided the Ottoman Empire’s Arab possessions but who were tearing Turkey itself to pieces. Certainly Mustafa Kemal, who led the Turkish people’s struggle for the rebirth of independence, for the establishment of a republic and for reform, was ideologically opposed to the Bolsheviks, but

18 Sources of Messianism and pragmatism
this did not prevent the rapprochement of the two countries. On 16 March 1921 a Treaty of Friendship and Brotherhood was signed in Moscow which settled the question of the Soviet-Turkish border. The Soviet government declared that it did not recognize any international acts which concerned Turkey if they had not been recognized by the government of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (the first of these being the Sevres Treaty of 1920, the purpose of which was to partition Turkey and make it dependent on the countries of the Entente). The Moscow treaty was supplemented by the Kars treaty of 13 October 1921, between Turkey and the Transcaucasian Republics that had by that time been Sovietized, while a treaty between Turkey and the Ukraine was signed in Ankara during the visit of M. V. Frunze on 2 January 1922. Finally the Treaty on Neutrality and NonAggression was concluded on 17 December 1925.
On 21 February 1921 under the leadership of Reza Khan, Persian Cossacks carried out a coup d’état in Iran. Headed by Zia al-Din, the new government (in which Reza Khan became war minister and later proclaimed himself Shah of Iran) cancelled the abortive Anglo-Iranian agreement of 1919 and decided on 26 February 1921 to sign a Soviet-Iranian treaty according to which the Soviet government renounced the Russian imperialist government’s policy of force, and declared null and void all treaties and agreements that had been concluded between the former tsarist government and Iran and that infringed on the latter’s rights. The two states undertook that neither side would create or allow to be located on their respective territories any organizations whose goal was to struggle against Russia or Iran. Article 6 of the treaty stated that:
The Two High Contracting Parties agree that, in case any third countries try, by means of armed interference, to realise a policy of aggrandizement in the territory of Persia or to turn the territory of Persia into a base for military operations against Russia; if by so doing they threaten the security of the borders of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic or of its allies; and if the Government of Persia, being warned by the Russian Soviet Government, fails to avert the danger by itself, the Russian Soviet Government will have the right to bring its troops into the territory of Persia and, in the interests of self-defence, to take the necessary military measures. With the danger eliminated, the Russian Soviet Government pledges itself immediately to withdraw its troops from the bounds of Persia.
Soviet scholars and Soviet politicians both characterised the treaty as an “example of equal relations”.16
Amir Amanullah came to power in Afghanistan in February 1919. His government was guided by the ideas of “young Afghans” and proclaimed the independence of Afghanistan, thus ensuring the new amir the support of the army and of the people at large. Having rejected the new government’s proposals of 3 March 1919 concerning the establishment of Anglo-Afghani relations on the basis of equality, Great Britain launched a third war against Afghanistan. Soviet Russia had been the first to recognize the sovereignty of Afghanistan in March 1919

Sources of Messianism and pragmatism 19
and to confirm its readiness to exchange embassies (as expressed in a letter from Lenin to Kabul in May 1919). The British army failed to defeat the Afghans, and in accordance with the 1919 Rawalpindi Treaty, Britain gave preliminary recognition to Afghanistan’s independence, confirming this after the Soviet-Afghani treaty of friendship had been concluded on 28 February 1921. The USSR and Afghanistan signed a Treaty on Neutrality and Non-Agression in 1926, similar to that concluded with Turkey,17 and Amanullah Khan, king of Afghanistan, visited the USSR in May 1928.
Diplomatic relations were established between the USSR and the Hejaz in 1924, when an official Soviet representative went to Jiddah, the town in which foreign diplomatic missions to the Hejaz were stationed. At the end of 1925 and the beginning of 1926 Hejaz was conquered by the neighbouring Sultanate of Nejd and a united state was created (known since 1932 as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). The Soviet government was the first to recognise and to establish diplomatic relations with the new state, and the USSR sent it consignments of commodities that included sugar, oil products and textiles during 1926–1927.
Yemen’s independence was recognized by the USSR in 1926, at a time when Yemen faced serious conflict and confrontation with Great Britain and Italy. The governor of Hodeida, Prince Saif ul-Islam Muhammad wrote in a letter to the Soviet government:
At present your government firmly declares its desire to establish understanding with the peoples of the East and especially with those who have a progressive way of thinking and who fight against imperialist oppression. The Great Russian Government vigilantly stands guard over the interests of the East. Imperialists are fighting against this government, spending huge sums of money and using their military and political forces, in order to prevent the peoples of the East from being enlightened by the light of freedom. This government is winning the sympathies of the oppressed peoples. We hope that good relations between your government and this government will be established.18
In 1928, when British military forces in the south and Saudi Arabia in the north were both exerting considerable pressure on Yemen, a formal request was made to the USSR’s plenipotentiary in Hejaz for the establishment of official trade relations between the USSR and Yemen, and essential goods started to arrive at the Yemeni port of Hodeida from the Soviet Union. In November 1928 the USSR and Yemen concluded a Treaty of friendship and Trade, whose preamble stated that the treaty was based on “the recognition of mutual equality of the Parties in everything pertinent to rights and common provisions existing among countries and peoples”, while Article I emphasized that the Soviet Union recognized the complete and absolute independence of the government of Yemen and of its king.19
At this point it seems that one would have to support the assessment of Soviet state policy with regard to Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and independent Arab countries as being a successful manifestation of pragmatism and sober sense

that served the interests of the population of Russia and the Soviet Union. Certainly all Soviet literature on the subject gives this interpretation of the measures that we have described above, which in a good sense were different from the calls for revolution, for struggle against “lackeys of imperialism”, “bloodthirsty dogs” and so on. But if one knows for sure that in the eyes of the Soviet leaders economics has always been the servant of politics, and that the ambitions of the leaders have always been higher than the interests of the State, and that the interests of the State have – always! – been placed above human lives, one inevitably finds that there is a second, underlying level of activity among the then Soviet leaders.
The USSR’s domestic and foreign policy was formulated either by people of conviction who, for the sake of ideological ‘principles’, were ready to violate society’s moral and legal norms and to sacrifice others and sometimes (though rarely) themselves, or else by people who from the very beginning were prepared for anything, for the sake of personal survival, promotion and material gain. The second group swallowed up the first because the bureaucratic structure of the lumpenproletarian dictatorship in the USSR was not suited to such idealistically-minded “ideologists”. Alternatively the “ideologists” of the first group degenerated into the second type though without for a single minute relinquishing Marxism-Leninism which they attempted to put to practical use. There were in fact individuals among the practitioners of the “ideological” models who took words and slogans seriously, although even the most honest of them became participants in political practices that were a very far cry from the ideals they proclaimed.
In response to a request for aid from Mustafa Kemal, Lenin ordered the despatch of 60,000 guns, accompanied by two to three thousand cartridges for each gun, 108 field batteries and 12 heavy batteries, and 10 million gold roubles, all of which were delivered to Turkey in 1921. The 10 million gold roubles were equivalent to 30,000 tons of flour or 60 million kilogrammes of bread,20 and in those days bread meant life. There was famine in the Volga area, with huge numbers of people dying of hunger and many instances of cannibalism. Had 10 million roubles been spent on importing grain, hundreds of thousands of people would have been saved from starving to death and there would have been bread to have fed them for one and half to two months. In fact this friendly gesture towards Turkey indicated the lack of any desire to avert the horrible consequences of famine in the Volga region, and cost the country a mountain of Russian, Chuvashi, Tatar and Mordvinian corpses, both old and young.
The figures may not be quite accurate. Had the grain been purchased it might have reached the starving people too late and in “insufficient quantities”. But there is no doubt that the lives of hundreds of thousands of fellow citizens were sacrificed by the “leaders of the Russian proletariat” for the sake of a political goal – assistance for and cooperation with Turkey – and that that “assistance” in fact meant the seizing and return of several thousand square kilometres of territory to Turkey. Even 60 or 70 years later it can hardly be claimed that those actions were in any way “pragmatic” or that they served national and state interests.
If only actions such as this had been the exception!

Next came the years of the early 1930s when collectivization destroyed agriculture and the peasantry. The Ukraine and Southern Russia which had the blackest and most fertile soil in the world were starving. Millions of people died and again numerous cases of cannibalism were recorded. Yet flour, grain, sugar and oil products were sold in the Hejaz and Yemen, in Eritrea, Djibouti and in Egypt.
Another decade and a half passed, and at the end of the 1940s the country, still starving after the war, was once again exporting grain. What scales could weigh the absurdity of this policy and of the “foreign economic ties” that condemned many fellow citizens not just to a tightening of their belts but, possibly, to hunger and death? As to “foreign policy”, this very expression, like “domestic policy”, strikes one as a meaningless combination of words, a nonsense, when concretely applied.
Bolshevik rule began with a civil war which wiped out three to four times the number of victims that had been removed by World War I, and which was then followed by mass emigration and several periods of famine while some more millions perished in concentration camps. The state of general unpreparedness for World War II and the extermination of the officer corps cost the country a further 27 million or so lives. Even after a certain period of development and a degree of progress, this self-destruction continued, so that in 1990, and notwithstanding an unprecedentedly abundant harvest, the country was once again faced with food shortages and had to receive charity aid from abroad. Certainly there existed another truth: irrespective of all else, during all these decades the vast country was living, creating, producing, building, performing feats of valour, making discoveries and contributing to the world’s civilization. There was in fact a permanent combination of reason and lunacy, lofty ideals and criminal cynicism, logic and absurdity both within and outside the country.
There was very little activity in Soviet foreign policy in the Near and Middle East during the 1920s and 1930s. Trade and economic cooperation with Turkey and Iran continued, and included the construction of textile factories in Turkey. Economic relations with Egypt failed to develop at this time because Soviet trade representatives were accused of subversive activity and thrown out. In 1930 the Soviet government extended a credit of US$8 million to Turkey with which to buy Soviet equipment.21
At the height of Stalin’s campaign of reprisals against party and Soviet cadres during 1937–1938, the USSR recalled all the members of the diplomatic mission from Jiddah, and Ambassador K. A. Khakimov and many other diplomats were executed. Formally, diplomatic relations were preserved but in practice they were non-existent; nor was there anyone in Moscow at that time to assess the consequences of this, since the attentions of the Soviet leadership were focused on Europe. During this period, Nazi Germany and the other Axis powers were becoming an increasingly real danger for the USSR, and it was decided at the Seventh and final Congress of the Comintern that the most effective strategy in the struggle against Fascism would be a return to a broad united front. Concurrently it was agreed that a general front of “all democratic countries” would be created against the “authoritarian regimes”. Both communist parties and all working

people had to be concerned with the concerns of the USSR because “interest in defending the Soviet Union determines the attitude of the world proletariat to war”.22 Anti-British and anti-French activity around the world tended to take second place, except during a short period following the conclusion of the Treaty of Non-aggression between Germany and the USSR.
During the Molotov-Ribbentrop discussions the USSR’s People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs talked about his country’s interest in a sphere of influence south of the Batumi-Baku line in the direction toward the Persian Gulf. This vague wording later allowed many historians to interpret Soviet foreign policy as “imperial expansionism”, and to speak about an “age-long striving” by Russia for warm seas. Here one would suggest a different explanation: the talks and treaties with Germany took place because of the desire not to find oneself face-to-face with Germany’s military machine as a result of Anglo-French policy. Had any global partition been designed, it would have indicated that the Kremlin wanted to eliminate British influence in the area to the south of the Soviet borders and to prevent the establishment there of German domination. According to this interpretation the Soviet policy would instead have met the goal of protecting the security of the USSR and would thus not have run counter to the interests of the peoples in the region.
Nazi Germany’s aggression against the USSR meant that the Soviet government had to be guided in its Middle East policy by the logics of war and survival. According to Soviet propaganda, Britain, which the Baku manifesto had called an “imperialist power” and a “miserable handful of oppressors”, had now turned into a great democratic power fighting against the “brown plague”. It was decided to occupy Iran, whose leadership was pro-Nazi, and Soviet troops entered Iran on 25 August 1941. Infused with the tone and logic of prevailing propaganda clichés, Pravda recorded that “A grey-haired old man said, ‘I am greeting you for the sake of Article 6 of the Treaty of 1921’”.23 At the same time British troops were brought into the southern part of Iran, and the Shah, Reza Pahlavi, was overthrown and deported. In 1943, diplomatic relations were established between the USSR and Egypt.
The end of World War II meant a radical change in the global balance of forces. The Soviet army, the mightiest land force in the world, was stationed at the centre of Western Europe and in Manchuria. Germany and Japan, defeated, were in ruins, Britain and France had effectively ceased to be great powers, and a rapid “Sovietization” of Eastern Europe was taking place, transforming its countries into “People’s Democracies” and a “socialist camp”. The United States, effectively untouched by the war, possessed half of the world’s industrial potential and nuclear weaponry and believed that the era of “Pax Americana” had come, though the Soviet Union, shattered but still flexing its muscles, opposed this.
By now anti-British and anti-French movements were gaining strength in the Arab countries, but were of little interest to the Kremlin. Turkey and Iran, the USSR’s neighbours, were another matter, with Turkey, whose leadership had neither confidence in, nor sympathies for the communists or for Russia, maintaining a slightly unfriendly neutrality. And did it not become known later that the Turkish

Sources of Messianism and pragmatism 23
leader Sarajoglu had told von Papen, Hitler’s ambassador, that “as a Turk” he had wanted Russia to be defeated?24
Elated by victory over such a strong enemy and confident in the numbers of his divisions and tanks, the Soviet leadership decided to squeeze the greatest concession out of Turkey, namely military control over the Straits. The treaty of 17 December 1925 was renounced, and the Soviet government demanded bases in the Straits (“joint defence of the Straits”) and the return of the provinces of Kars and Ardahan, which had previously belonged to Tsarist Russia but which had been given to Turkey in accordance with the terms of the 1925 treaty. The demand for the return of these poor and strategically insignificant territories may have been intended to modify the main issue of the bases in the Straits. Certainly, as participants in those events confirm, Stalin kept troops ready to invade Turkey.
However, the raised fist did not strike the blow. The military operation against Turkey was too difficult – a blitz operation would surely fail, while Stalin was simply not prepared for a confrontation with the United States and Britain over control of the Straits. The ultimatum turned out to be bluff and in the end had quite the opposite effect from what had been intended, since it consolidated Turkish society on a nationalistic, anti-Soviet and anti-Russian footing, and pushed the Turkish government off the path of neutrality and persuaded it to join in the NATO alliance from where it became an initiator of, or a participant in, antiSoviet military blocs in the Middle East. Instead of a consolidation of the security of the Southern borders there was over several decades a considerable worsening of the USSR’s strategic position: as the half million-strong Turkish army became a component part of NATO, the bloc’s southern flank shifted directly to the borders of the USSR, while American air bases and (from 1961–1963) missile bases equipped with Jupiter nuclear medium-range ballistic missiles were established that could reach the major economic regions of the Soviet Union – the Ukraine and southern Russia, in Transcaucasia and the Volga region.
According to American experts, Stalin’s claim to the Straits was one of the main causes and reasons for the beginning of the Cold War. US President Harry Truman in his speech at the US Congress in March 1947 spoke of the need to provide military and economic aid to Turkey along with Greece for the protection of their “freedom”. This statement, which became known as the Truman Doctrine, is usually considered to be the starting point of the Cold War, although many researchers date it back to Churchill’s Fulton speech in March 1946.
For many innocent people, the confrontation with Turkey had tragic consequences. Tens of thousands of Meskheti Turks who had formerly lived in Georgia were deported to Central Asia where in 1989 they fell victim to the pogroms carried out by the Uzbek population and were again uprooted from their homes and scattered all over the Soviet Union because the Georgians refused to take them back. There is a theory that Josef Stalin, encouraged by Lavrenty Beria, the all-powerful chief of the secret police, threatened Turkey, but no documentary evidence for this view has been produced.
Certain erroneous and irresponsible actions, albeit in different form, were also undertaken in Iran. British and American occupation troops had been withdrawn

24 Sources of Messianism and pragmatism
from Iran by December 1945, but the USSR – under an obligation to withdraw within six months – was slow to do so. The temptation to subject Iran to Soviet influence was too much for Stalin. Here in front of him was a militarily powerless country in which a Leftist radical movement, represented by the Tudeh party and the nationalist movements in Iranian Azerbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan, had increased its strength during the war years. And what if . . . ? The green light was given for the creation of the Azerbaijan and the Mahabad (Kurdish) Republics, in the hope that under Soviet auspices their autonomy (or independence) would be consolidated and permanent pressure would thus be exerted on Teheran.
But again Stalin miscalculated. As yet there were no forces within these territories that were ready to fight seriously against the central government, and once more it was demonstrated that the centripetal forces making up the motley picture of Iranian districts and nationalities were stronger than the centrifugal ones. The “cold war” began in the international arena, when Harry Truman, the American president, sent Stalin a note that was virtually an open ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Iran. At this time the US was producing ever increasing quantities of nuclear weaponry while the Soviet Union had none. As in the case of Turkey, Stalin did not want a military confrontation with the West over mastery of Iran, and Soviet troops were withdrawn, whereupon the Shah’s army smashed the Azerbaijan and the Mahabad (Kurdish) Republics.
In an attempt to save face and to extract some economic benefit from Iran, the Soviet government had signed a treaty with the premier, Kavame Saltane, that granted oil concessions and other privileges to the USSR in northern Iran. However, following the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the rout of the Azerbaijan and Mahabad Republics, the Iranian majlis (parliament) refused to ratify the treaty. This meant that relations between Moscow and Teheran were to remain hostile for many years, although at that stage the situation was less straightforwardly hopeless than it was in Turkey. The dissensions between Britain and Iran over oil and unequal treaties were so strong that had the USSR applied a wiser and more flexible policy, the dividends might have been higher. By now, though, the Soviet leadership was completely absorbed by the “theory” of the hostility of the national bourgeoisie – that is, the hostility demonstrated by all nationalistic and reformist forces in Asia and Africa towards the interests of communism, of national liberation and, consequently, of the USSR itself.
This vision of the “Third World” painted a gloomy picture not only of the mishaps in Turkey and Iran but also those in Israel. Soviet-Israeli relations are discussed later, so we will simply note here that Stalin’s hopes of Israel being a state within the Middle East friendly to the USSR were to be frustrated. Another serious political failure in the Third World resulted in an anti-Semitic campaign in the USSR and a negative attitude towards anti-Western (anti-imperialist) potential in Asia and Africa. The “theoretician” and academician E. Zhukov remarked on the way “A relentless denunciation of reactionary bourgeois nationalistic ideology in its different forms (Kemalism, Gandhism, Zionism and Pan-Arabism) accelerates the process of national and social liberation of peoples in colonial and dependent countries”. He also noted how the national reformists in such countries

Sources of Messianism and pragmatism 25
mendaciously insisted on their “wish to remain aloof” from the struggle, and on their “neutrality” in the so-called “ideological conflict” between the USSR and the USA even though, together with the reactionary bourgeoisie, they were simultaneously smearing the USSR and actively helping the imperialists.25
Some years later, John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State in the Eisenhower administration, would call the non-aligned movement “ ‘immoral”. The extremes tally. As the 19th Congress of the CPSU stated, “the bourgeoisie in the developing countries has thrown the banner of national freedom aboard”.26 And the whole Soviet “social science” reptile started to repeat, to explain and to illustrate this immortal declaration in a variety of ways, with the result that the prominent Iranian bourgeois nationalist leader Muhammad Mosaddeq turned out to be “an imperialist lackey”, and the rather anti-Western nationalist Gamal Abdel Nasser appeared to be virtually an American agent and a “fascist”.
The common theme of Soviet propaganda and official statements reflected the logic of the Soviet leadership’s thinking. The former allies in the war against “German fascism and Japanese militarism” found themselves separated by the trenches, fronts and borders of the “cold war”. A bi-polar world was formed, which was also two-coloured – black and white. It embraced “them” and “us”, the “forces of war and reaction” and the “forces of peace and progress”. There was no third side. This was the global dichotomy in the perception of the Soviet leadership and, as it happened, was a mirror image of a similar approach in Washington. Soviet social scientists and “theoreticians” stated that capitalism had entered the second stage of its overall crisis. “Communism, the bright future of humanity” was coming. Socialist revolutions would burst forth and would take place in the form of armed coups d’état and civil wars that would be carried out under the guidance of communists by the working masses against their own and the foreign bourgeoisies. Because violence is the midwife of history, international relations are just a form of class struggle, and since war means the continuation of politics by different means, the capitalist countries, led by the USA, were preparing a war against the USSR. “Imperialism knew” that the USSR and “the other socialist countries” represented a base of support for the proletariat in the West and for the national liberation movement. Both the Soviet Union and its allies had to become an armed stronghold in order to rebuff the “imperialist intrigues” and to be ready for an inevitable war. As Lenin taught us, the people’s struggle against colonial and semi-colonial dependence weakens imperialism and therefore deserves to be supported by the leading socialist country in the world and by the entire “socialist camp”.
After the civil war, the communists were victorious in China, and Stalin treated this communist giant that had appeared on the Soviet Union’s borders with caution: there were wars going on in Korea and in Indo-China and force alone was determining people’s destinies and their movement towards the “bright tomorrow”. Yet the advent of nuclear weaponry challenged the methods of achieving that “bright future”.
The advent of nuclear weaponry in the US and frank statements about the effectiveness of Washington’s nuclear “club” created a direct threat to the national

26 Sources of Messianism and pragmatism
security of the USSR and its position in the world. Therefore the task to be undertaken was to produce Soviet nuclear weaponry and then to build up the maximum nuclear potential and the means of delivering it. Even a “liberal” leader would have no other choice. This, in particular, was proved when Britain and France became nuclear powers, among other things in order to increase their political weight in world politics.
Stepping outside the framework of our theme, we note that the rigid confrontation initiated by the de facto declaration of the Cold War by President Truman in March 1947 reflected this leader’s similar black and white vision of the world and his erroneous approach to the relations with the USSR. The West’s policy, which was later defined by Mao Tse Tung as “a spearhead against a spearhead”, helped to consolidate the Soviet regime, broadened the scope of the machinery of repression and encouraged a military and industrial trend in the development of economies and of science. Human contacts, open borders, negotiations and exchanges could all have corrupted the “socialist society”. Three decades later all these would appear – but this is another subject.
Objectively we should note that although separated from the realities of the Near and Middle East, Soviet policy and propaganda during Stalin’s time did not score too badly in the Arab countries. Additionally the Soviet government, both before and following a short period of flirtation with Israel, offered the Arab countries a number of successful and timely gestures of support. Certainly in the Arab world, the image of the Soviet Union was becoming increasingly positive, as the USSR supported the demands for the withdrawal of British troops from Egypt and for the granting of independence to the Lebanon and to Syria, and later to Libya. Between 1952 and 1955 Soviet representatives at the United Nations Organization invariably and actively participated in discussions on issues concerning Tunisia and Morocco, and supported their struggle for independence.
True to its traditional disregard for the needs of its own people, the Soviet government always found commodities that could be sold to Arab countries or exchanged with them for various other goods; these latter, though badly needed by the USSR, were still much less important than food which continued to be in deficit. In 1948, for instance, when the country was suffering a major food shortage, the USSR nevertheless agreed to deliver 235,000 tons of wheat to Egypt in exchange for 38,000 tons of cotton.27
In October 1951 the governments of America, Britain, France and Turkey proposed to the Arab countries and Israel that they should participate in the so-called Middle East Command for the joint defence of the Middle East. Their proposal also provided for Western military missions to be established and for foreign troops to be located in the territories of these countries who should additionally give up some bases to the Middle East Command. The plan was sharply condemned by the Soviet government, and Cairo Radio commented at the time that “Egypt agrees wholly with the opinion expressed in the Soviet note to the effect that the participation of the Arab countries in the joint Middle East Command would limit the sovereignty of these countries and subordinate them to the selfish interests of the great powers”.28 Similar statements were made by the leaders of

Syria and Lebanon. The influential Egyptian paper Al-Misri, the then organ of the ruling Wafd Party, wrote on 20 October 1951 that “The developments of recent days have undoubtedly proved that Egypt can expect nothing good from the imperialist powers . . . . Nothing is left for us but to turn to a new ally who approves of our policy and who can help us to fulfil our national aspirations”.29 And in May 1951 Abd al-Latif Yunis, a member of the Syrian parliament stated: “I demand from the Syrian government and from the governments of the other Arab countries that they conclude treaties with the Soviet Union within the shortest time”.30

2 The rise and fall of Nikita S. Khrushchev
When in March 1953 the heirs of Josef Stalin took up the reins of government of a huge country and assumed the dominant position in the even greater “socialist camp” in which a third of the human race was living, they were faced with a number of political priorities. Priority was given first and foremost to the struggle for power, or for the individual’s own place in the upper echelons of power. In this struggle Nikita Khrushchev demonstrated outstanding statecraft and won a number of significant victories, yet it ended with his fall. The second priority was the situation inside the country, while the state of affairs within the “socialist camp” was the third. The fourth priority was given to relations with the United States and the West as a whole, chiefly in the context of the cold war and military rivalry. The Third World, however, was not included among the political priorities.
All the Soviet leaders had inherited and personally shared, with more or less sincerity, the basic ideological and political views of Stalin. Khrushchev, a selfmade man and something of a rough diamond, became a prominent political leader with a wealth of practical experience outside the Kremlin, although he was a tragic rather than a comic figure. His view of the world was in fact much less blinkered than that of most of his fellows, and political instinct prompted him and his entourage to reject the more odious of the practices that had been used by his predecessors to rule the country. He closed down concentration camps, and sought new forms of coexistence and encounter with the West. The Third World gradually began to capture his attention.
For the sectarian Bolshevist slogan “He who is not with us is against us”, Khrushchev substituted the new slogan “He is with us who is not against us”. He established friendly relations with Jawaharlal Nehru, the Indian prime minister, and with Sukarno, President of Indonesia, when he visited these countries at the end of 1955. He also went to Afghanistan with Nikolai Bulganin, the then Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, and became convinced that the situation in all these countries was by no means identical with the model that had been proposed by Stalin. He realized that the policy of the Afro-Asian states, who had adopted the five principles of peaceful coexistence or “panchashailat” at the Bandung Conference in April 1955, actually did not contradict Soviet policy but rather widened the gap between these states and the West. Khrushchev and his close associates had earlier on begun to look attentively at the large anti-Western

30 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
(“anti-imperialist”) potential of many Arab countries, and easily observed their readiness to cooperate with the USSR.
Not only did the Report of the Central Committee of the CPSU presented by Khrushchev to the 20th Party Congress include a disclosure of “the cult of personality”, but for the first time the authors of the report paid much attention to the countries of the Third World. It was noted that the new period in world history “which Lenin had predicted” had begun, in which the peoples of the East were playing an active part in deciding the destinies of the whole world, and attention was drawn to the fact that in contrast to the pre-war period, most Asian countries were now acting in the world arena as sovereign states or as states upholding their right to an independent foreign policy. As the report noted, “International relations have spread beyond the bounds of relations between the countries inhabited chiefly by peoples of the white race and are beginning to acquire the character of genuinely world-wide relations”.1 This was echoed in the Congress Resolution which for the first time declared that “the forces of peace” had been considerably augmented “by the emergence on the world arena of a group of peace-loving European and Asian states which have proclaimed non-participation in military blocs as a principle of their foreign policy”, and that, as a result, a vast worldwide “Zone of Peace” had emerged which embraced both socialist and non-socialist peace-loving states in Europe and Asia and which “included more than half the world’s population”.2
A further step was taken in re-evaluating the realities of the Third World at the 21st Congress of the CPSU (in January–February 1959), when it was stated that most of the colonial and semi-colonial countries that had until recently been merely the “reserve and rear of imperialism” were so no longer. It was also further pointed out that countries “with different social systems . . . were struggling against imperialism and colonialism, for freedom and national independence”.3 The 22nd Congress of the CPSU (in October 1961) went as far as to declare that the emergence in the world arena of the newly-liberated states of Asia and Africa and their active role in solving problems of war and peace “had substantially changed the alignment of forces in favour of peace-loving humanity”4 (i.e. the USSR and its allies), and had radically altered the entire system of international relations. Both the 21st and the 22nd Congresses observed that the progressive role of the national bourgeoisie that had come to power in a number of newly independent countries had not yet been exhausted, and that this bourgeoisie was able to participate in the solution of pressing national problems. Nevertheless there was no trust in national bourgeoisies, for they showed an increasing inclination to “compromise with imperialism and domestic reaction as long as the class struggle was continuing to sharpen” within a country.
Political practice, which was becoming more flexible and successful than it had been previously, demanded that the remaining Messianic slogans – without which it could not exist – should be changed and inveterate formulations abandoned. Khrushchev’s team was quick to find new clichés that would be appropriate for the times and that could be used for the “theoretical” and propagandist embellishment of their Third World policy, producing such slogans as “the non-capitalist

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 31
path of development”, “revolutionary democracy”, and “national democracy”. Thus the world no longer looked black and white, and neither was it divided any more into “them” and “us”. Development towards “a bright future” was gaining momentum and did not necessarily demand the shedding of blood, while the alignment of world forces shifted “in favour of socialism” and made it possible to prevent “aggressive actions of imperialism”. Various forms of transition to socialism could be used, including the potential for development towards peaceful revolution.
It is unlikely that the poorly educated but energetic and emotional Nikita Khrushchev would ever have questioned the Leninist-Stalinist ideas of “the general crisis of capitalism” and “the scientifically-grounded” transition to “the Communist formation”.
“I’m delighted with New York City, I’ll own, But I won’t ﬂip my cap off my crown.
We Soviet chaps have a pride of our own, On bourgeois tricks we look down!”
These naive words by Vladimir Mayakovsky could have been repeated by Khrushchev with complete sincerity. But the new Soviet leader rejected the idea of an unavoidable blood-bath as a necessary element in any change of formation, and this is what became the arresting novelty. When he said “We will bury you!” to the Americans, he meant only in the socio-political, not in the military or human sense. He rejected the idea of war in the nuclear epoch as being “a continuation of politics by other means” (although in practice he bluffed effectively and certainly played for high stakes). He sincerely supported the idea of peaceful coexistence, but on the basis of a competition, including in the military-political sphere (without unleashing a global nuclear war), expecting the victory of socialism in the person of the Soviet Union.
When Anatoly Gromyko,5 the son of the Soviet Foreign Minister who occupied that position permanently for more than quarter of a century, was asked by the present author what event had most influenced the thinking of his father and of the other Soviet leaders, the reply was “the twenty-second of June 1941”,6 a response echoed without exception, though in various forms and with different emphases, by all the political figures from among the older generation who had formulated or executed Soviet foreign policy. Without a proper understanding of this event it is impossible correctly to evaluate the Soviet leadership’s vision of the world up to the time when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power or to evaluate the situation vis-a-vis the Middle East. This date – 22nd June 1941 – signals the day on which war broke out, the cruellest and most destructive war in recent centuries or perhaps indeed throughout mankind’s entire history. It was a war of enormous human sacrifice and devastation, and its deepest wounds would determine political behaviour, both national and international, for the next two generations. “Oh darling, I wish there would be no war!” is the refrain of a popular Russian song, meaning that the citizens of the USSR, and especially the Russians, would

32 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
sacrifice everything to avoid war. To avoid war they had to bear hardship and loss, and to avoid war they had to prepare themselves for it by becoming so strong that no one would dare to attack them.
Nuclear superiority was considered by Washington to be an important element in “containing” the USSR, while the dominance in Europe of ground forces and tank divisions ready to bleed and brand the NATO countries as far as the Atlantic was regarded by Moscow as a means of “containing” the USA. The opposing blocs were unable to understand each other.
Perhaps Western political scholars were right when they wrote that Soviet leaders “were obsessed” with the problem of security. It was hard for American leaders, scholars and theorists in political and social sciences to understand them, since American society had not experienced any such national tragedy; no bombs had dropped on continental America. However, the “obsessed” Russians had had to live for decades in close proximity to American and British bases at which firststrike weapons were installed, and which, as the maps show, encircled the Soviet Union. Such a degree of menace was totally unacceptable to “non-obsessed” American leaders, and the clever, self-controlled and resolute President John F. Kennedy brought his country to the brink of nuclear war when Khrushchev ventured on a gamble by attempting in 1962 to deploy Soviet medium-range missiles in Cuba. In his view he was making it too hot for the Americans by exposing them to the same threat that they had used against the Soviet Union, but the gamble failed. However, less than a decade later after the arsenals of intercontinental missiles had been stockpiled, the two powers at last reached parity. Both had attained the capability for multiple mutual annihilation, and that opened a path for strategic arms limitations.
(We may add in parenthesis: Americans did not understand what was happening in the minds of the Soviet leaders, just like Moscow did not understand American foreign policy, especially the domestic factors that were defining it. That is why Moscow took the nuclear blackmail by the participants of the 1956 tripartite aggression so seriously – this will be discussed in greater detail below. Only after the Cuban missile crisis, especially after Nixon’s coming to power and the start of strategic arms limitations talks in 1969, finally did the two capitals gradually begin to understand each other. After Nixon the détente began to fade away gradually under the pressure of hawks in both capitals).
As it happens, our interest lies elsewhere. Did the psychology of people who were “obsessed” with security and who had “the complex of 22 June 1941” influence the shaping of Soviet policy in the Middle East? The answer is unequivocally in the affirmative. Western military bases were located in the Middle and Near East (or had appeared, as in Turkey, as a result of Stalin’s wrong policy), and they had to be removed, which meant backing those forces that supported the dismantling of the bases. It may be useful to recall here that American bases were spread throughout Morocco, Libya, Turkey, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia as well as being located in Greece, Italy and Spain, while British bases were to be found in Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Palestine and Transjordan, in Britain’s Arabian possessions and in Cyprus. From the point of view of the Soviet leaders the regional

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 33
military alliances were an extension of NATO and served as a possible staging area for military operations against the USSR. These alliances had therefore to be undermined, and the forces – either nationalistic, religious or anti-Communist – which demanded their dissolution had to be given support.
According to Leninist theory these countries were the exploited reserve and rear of imperialism, i.e. of the West, of the United States and of those who directly “threatened” the USSR. Therefore it was in the USSR’s interest to undermine the political and economic positions of “imperialism” in the region. This approach derived from Khrushchev’s logic (which he had inherited from Lenin) that if the USSR was helping the Middle Eastern countries to win and then to consolidate their independence, it would accelerate the “dying” of the capitalist West inasmuch as the West could not survive without sources of raw materials, without markets and without a cheap workforce. Thus the goal, which was not clearly formulated but was easily tangible and explicit, was to create throughout the entire region a group of politically independent and neutral states which would have neither foreign troops nor bases in their territories and which would maintain friendly economic, political and other relations with the USSR at a level similar to that applying in Soviet-Turkish relations between the two world wars. It is also obvious that in spite of divergent premises and different stimuli, the political goals of the Soviet leaders and local nationalists coincided materially or at least were common to both parties. As for the shift towards socialism by these countries, it might have become a desirable attainment but it was not an immediate result of Soviet political efforts. After all, humanity in general was moving towards socialism and the countries of this region would eventually come round to it as well. In addition “People’s Democracies” cost the Soviet Union too much for it to squander its rather meagre resources on new socialist countries if there was the likelihood of some emerging in the Middle East region.
Once again, it was not knowledge of the specific situation but rather intuition, political flair and certain awareness of the logic of the global struggle between the two superpowers that guided Khrushchev and facilitated his adoption of a correct and undoubtedly successful policy towards the Middle East. For the USSR, the region generally and the Arab countries in particular, acted as a tabula rasaon which Khrushchev, this excitable and self-willed leader, began boldly to inscribe his own history.
On the whole affairs in the Middle East and the Third World were developing in the ordinary course of events and according to their own internal laws and logic. A stubborn reluctance on the part of the British and French (not to mention Dutch, Belgian and Portuguese) leaders to relinquish “the white man’s burden” and to understand that their time had passed provoked animosity between these countries and the populations of the Third World. The political elite was antagonistic but was ready in principle to cooperate with the West. In practice, the former colonial powers had neither the strength nor the financial means nor the will to conduct imperial policy, and instead looked to the United States, the West’s mighty leader, for help and support. Since America had no imperial past in the countries of the Middle East, where the minds of representatives of the new classes and of

34 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
many intellectuals were captivated by “the American dream”, its popularity was extraordinarily high.
Although the US did not approve of the actions of its allies it preferred not to act against them. For the American Secretary of State, J. F. Dulles, the main enemy was Communism, to an extent that he virtually echoed the sectarian slogan of the communists of the 1920s and 1930s – “He who is not with us is against us”. In order to “counteract Communism and Soviet expansion”, Middle Eastern leaders “had to” join military blocs that were headed by the great powers of the West. Though the leaders of Turkey and Iran reacted favourably to such calls, they were simply beyond the comprehension of the Arabs. Indeed the pressure exerted on the latter by the United States, Britain and France caused a reverse reaction, and the efforts of Dulles actually helped the Soviet Union to pursue its policies in the Third World and particularly in the Middle and Near East. One of the national tasks of mass political movements (whose leaders later came to power in many Arab countries) was to win, and to strengthen, national independence, and this implied the severing of politically unequal treaties with European mother countries. Their other task was to get rid of the Western military presence and especially of foreign military bases, and to reinforce their own armed forces as a means of defending their national sovereignty and prestige and as a symbol of a new “equal” status. These movements also wished to develop independent economies, which implied an end to the privileged position enjoyed by foreign capital, and especially the foreign oil companies. An outside force, a state or a bloc of states that could identify its own policies with these popular expectations and with the ambitions of the political elite would become their natural ally. An enemy of Britain or France in this region automatically became a friend of the Arabs and other population groups.
So the table was laid and now they simply waited for a guest to arrive. This could only have been the Soviet Union, for its declared policy objectively answered to a general tendency of the historic process in the region and to the popular mood. However, before a final “invitation” could be extended to the USSR in the region, each side had to surmount its own barriers. These were higher for the region’s leaders, who were scared of the spread of Communism and whose fears were nurtured by their own nationalistic and social instincts, by the Western propaganda war that had been waged over many years, and by official Soviet atheism. However, their apprehensions were calmed by the fact that the local Communist parties were weak and that the minds of the masses were closed to Communist ideology. As far as Communism in the USSR was concerned, according to them, first this was the USSR’s own business and its own choice, and second the images created by Soviet propaganda, by some elements of the Soviet socio-political model and by the USSR’s military and industrial successes, exemplified by the thundering caterpillar tracks of tanks in showy parades, held many attractions for the local political elites. The word “socialism” (though not ‘communism’) became fashionable, while the word “capitalism” was made synonymous with the West’s political, economic and military supremacy and acquired a pejorative connotation.

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 35
Less effort was required from the Soviet side, which had only to remove the labels of “lackeys” and “collaborators” from all non-Communist leaders in the Middle East and in the Third World in general. The USSR had also to understand that new vistas would be opened up through the development of events in the region. This would be much in harmony with the Soviet Messianic vision of the world and its desire to strengthen its own security, were theory and practice to be applied more flexibly than they had been in Stalin’s time.
On 24 February 1955 a military alliance, christened the Baghdad Pact, was set up between Turkey, Iraq, Britain, Pakistan and Iran, and pressure was brought to bear on Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and other Arab countries to force them to join in the treaty. The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement (“On Security in the Middle East”) dated 16 April 1955 against the Pact. This document stated that the policy of creating military groups with the participation of Middle Eastern countries “rested on the aspiration of certain Western powers to bring these countries under colonial bondage” and that these powers now lacked the means “of establishing and preserving their domination according to previous methods . . . (and) were trying to bind the countries of the Middle East into aggressive blocs under . . . the false pretext of ensuring defence for the countries of the region”.7 It was further declared that the Soviet Union “would defend the freedom, independence and nonintervention into internal affairs of the states of the Middle East”.8
The new Soviet leadership in 1954–1955 had a natural desire to skip over the northern belt of the Middle East and to stretch out its hand to the Arab regimes that, for reasons of their own, refused to participate in the military alliances contrived by the West. As the most influential and the most populated Arab country, Egypt was the key to the Arab world and opened up exciting prospects. It is true that as recently as 1952–1953 the new leaders of Egypt had been labelled “bourgeois nationalistic” and called the agents of Western imperialism. But who cares about strong and heated words when common political interests are being discovered! Cairo did not consider the Soviet Union as an enemy. “The enemy” was Britain, with whom the monarchical regime in Baghdad, Cairo’s rival in the Arab world, was closely bound.
Gamal Abdel Nasser’s aim was to build a strong Egypt with a well-equipped army. The dream of having an independent and efficient armed force had been kept alive in Egypt ever since the humiliating defeat of Muhammad AH in the mid-19th century and the subsequent reduction of the Egyptian army to a token force imposed by the occupying British. Bound by obligations to limit arms supplies to the Middle East (since they did not want to strengthen Israel’s adversaries or to deliver weapons to unpredictable regimes), the Western powers refused to satisfy Nasser’s ambitions, arms supplies being in any case conditional upon his participation in the military blocs that they were organizing and upon the despatch of an American military mission to Egypt. Nasser began, though not without apprehension, to think of another source of weapons. Whether the Soviet Union took the initiative and proposed an arms deal to Egypt, or whether Egypt approached the USSR to ask for weapons is a mere detail, since both countries were moving steadily towards each other.

36 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
Nasser was an initial participant in formulating the concept and in shaping the policies of “positive neutrality” and non-alignment, and was one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement. As a young colonel, he had established close relations with the Indian prime minister Nehru, with Indonesia’s president Sukarno, and with the Yugoslavian leader J. B. Tito. In mid-February 1955 Nehru and Tito who, like Nasser, were also resolutely opposed to the Baghdad Pact, visited Egypt. Egypt was in contention with Iraq, India disagreed with Pakistan, and Yugoslavia nursed an intense and long-standing distrust of Turkey. Nasser had a profound respect for Nehru as a colleague and as an outstanding political leader, and it is quite possible that he was advised by Nehru and Tito on how best he might use East–West rivalry to his own advantage. He met Chou-En-Lai, chairman of the State Council of the People’s Republic of China, at the Bandung conference in 1955, and may well have concluded that if he drew closer to the Communist bloc he would strengthen his bargaining position vis-a-vis the West. However, he underestimated the dangers of playing this game, and the Western leaders, who were also the slaves of their own dogmas and stereotypes, began to treat him as an enemy and a communist agent.
The decision to ask for Soviet military aid was precipitated by an Israeli raid on Gaza on 28 February 1955 when the headquarters of an Egyptian garrison were destroyed and 38 men killed. Military weakness impelled Nasser to act without delay and on 27 September 1955 he announced that an Agreement on Military and Technical Cooperation had been signed between Egypt and Czechoslovakia. Khrushchev, who was gambling hard on the question of disarmament with the West may have felt that operating through Czechoslovakia would be expedient at this time. In fact, as Nasser himself admitted on 26 July 1956, the agreement was between Egypt and the USSR, and under its terms Egypt would receive heavy arms to the tune of US$225–$250 million in return for future supplies of cotton. The USSR undertook to supply MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighter planes, 11–28 bombers, medium and heavy tanks, artillery guns, submarines, torpedo boats, two destroyers and other military equipment.9 Egyptian officers would be trained initially in Czechoslovakia and Poland and then directly in the USSR, and Soviet and East European military instructors would come to Egypt.
Western leaders, in particular those of America and Great Britain, were enraged by Egypt, reacting fiercely and negatively to the news from Cairo. Yet the more the West criticized Nasser the more his prestige increased and respect for him grew, in Egypt and throughout the Arab world. Between 1953 and 1956 he signed a number of agreements on economic, technical and cultural cooperation with China and with East European countries, and a defence agreement aimed at strengthening Egypt’s security was concluded with Syria and – unexpectedly for many – Saudi Arabia in October 1955. In April of the following year Yemen joined the defence agreement between these three Arab countries.
Ways “to punish” Nasser and thereby to hold him up as an example to the entire Third World had undoubtedly been exercising the minds of Western leaders even before Egypt’s nationalization of the Suez Canal Company. When the nationalization was announced by Nasser at a mass rally in Alexandria on 26 July 1956,

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 37
London and Paris decided to regain the status quo ante by force and at the same time to get even with this troublesome Egyptian president. While negotiations and conferences kept the matter alive, “Operation Musketeer”, which involved military action on the part of Israel, was being carefully designed and prepared. The comings and goings of those months have of course been widely analyzed and discussed, and much new light has been shed by the recent public release of documents from the British archives of 1956–1957.
As soon as the crisis erupted, the Egyptian government declared that it would pay compensation to the shareholders in the Suez Canal Company and will act according to the letter and the spirit of the 1888 Constantinople Convention on the freedom of navigation.10 At a conference of Suez Canal users held in London in August 1956, in which a Soviet delegation headed by the Foreign Minister Dimitri Shepilov participated, Western governments tried to impose on Egypt a scheme that would allow Britain and France to retain control of the canal. However, the considerable divergences among the participants meant that no decision was taken, the anti-Egyptian plans being frustrated by the joint efforts of the Soviet delegation and non-aligned states. But neither Britain nor France, whose warlike preparations for Operation Musketeer were proceeding at full speed had the slightest interest in any sort of peaceful settlement of the conflict, and on the night of 30 October 1956 Israeli forces went ahead and invaded Sinai. The question of the Israeli attack was immediately raised in the UN Security Council and at the same time Britain and France, acting according to their carefully planned scenario, presented Egypt and Israel with an “ultimatum” demanding the withdrawal of troops from the Canal Zone. On 31 October Anglo-French aircraft began to bomb the Canal Zone, Cairo and Alexandria, an action that drew sharp protests from the USSR and much diplomatic action at the UN, in support of Egypt.
Operation Musketeer proved less successful than had been planned. Though the Egyptian army sustained a defeat it had still managed to put up strong resistance, and in spite of military failures, Nasser’s regime survived. Even before the military operations had begun, the wave of anti-Western sentiment had become so powerful in the Arab world and indeed globally that the United States chose, quite categorically, to dissociate itself from its allies, and later condemned their actions at the United Nations. (One of the traditional assertions of Soviet literature on the Middle East to the effect that the US “connived with aggressors” and “pandered to . . . (and) conspired with them” is thus no more than a routine contribution to the usual anti-American rhetoric.)
It was a golden chance for the Soviet leaders and they did not miss it. All the weight of Soviet diplomacy and the might of the propaganda machine was directed to attacking the Western powers, as a result of which the USSR gained many new supporters. The coincidence of the hostilities against Egypt and the uprising by Hungary against Soviet domination and against the Stalinist “socialist” regime that was imposed on it allowed Khrushchev to put down the latter with a minimum of political loss. And that is not all. At the peak of military operations Khrushchev, aware of the negative attitude of the United States, ventured a masterly manoeuvre by threatening to use force and then applying the nuclear bluff.

38 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
On 5 November 1956 Shepilov sent a telegram to the Chairman of the UN Security Council demanding the urgent convening of the Council to discuss the question of non-compliance by Britain, France and Israel with the Resolution agreed in a special session of the UN General Assembly, and to consider immediate measures to curb the aggression against Egypt. The same telegram contained a draft resolution proposing that if the demands to halt military aggression were not met, then all member states of the UN, and above all the US and the USSR, would provide military aid to Egypt, and the Soviet government confirmed that “it was ready to make its contribution to curb the aggressors, to defend the victim of aggression, and to restore peace by sending to Egypt the air and naval forces necessary for this purpose”.11 It is worth mentioning that at the time the Soviet Union in fact had neither air nor naval forces available for operations in the Middle East area. On the night of 6 November 1956 the Head of the Soviet government sent messages to his counterparts in Britain (Anthony Eden), France (Guy Mollet) and Israel (David Ben-Gurion) in which he expressed “his full determination to smash the aggressors and restore peace in the Middle East by the use of force”.12
This nuclear ultimatum – the first and only one in the nuclear era – is usually hushed up in Western literature, and it is interesting to note that the documents reflecting the reaction to the ultimatum and evaluating possible Soviet behaviour were not among those recently released from the British archives and will remain secret for another 30 years. However, the present author quite fortuitously discovered a document in the UK archives, in the form of a memorandum prepared on the eve of the Suez adventure by the British Joint Chiefs of Staff for the New Zealand government, which throws light on British (and possibly French) reactions.13
The authors of the memorandum maintained that the “Communist bloc” had not departed from its long-term purpose of establishing Communist domination throughout the world. According to them, the Soviet leaders were aware that a global war waged with modern weapons of mass destruction could lead to mutual devastation at an absolutely unacceptable level, which was why the USSR and its allies would not start a global war as a reasoned political act and would not deliberately run risks on any occasion when such actions would exacerbate the danger of such a war occurring. Thus the policy of “peaceful coexistence”, the writers felt, offered the best opportunity for the Communist bloc to expand its influence, but the risk of a global war could arise from a miscalculation that might occur in two ways: (a) the anti-Communist nations might make a wrong appraisal of the other party’s reaction in the given circumstances, and (b) two parties might get involved in a dispute that was basically not their own; because of its support of non-bloc countries or due to its policy of “competitive coexistence”, the Soviet bloc might get involved in disputes between the Western and non-bloc nations, as, for example, between Britain and Egypt. In the prevailing circumstances, the authors thought, the risk of a limited war was generated mainly as a result of miscalculation.
Thus Stalin was predictable but Khrushchev could “miscalculate” his actions. According to the assessments it was highly unlikely that the Soviet Union would run the risk of a nuclear war. But what if Nikita Khrushchev, an uneducated and

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 39
emotional sort of chap, was not bluffing? What if the USA would not support its allies? It would be better to retreat.
The present author met Professor Walter Rostow, former adviser to the Eisenhower administration, in Austin, Texas, on 17 September 1990, who remarked to me that “The evaluation of Khrushchev’s possible behaviour by the US administration was almost the same as in the document that you found. This is what I was told by Henry Cabot Lodge, and he was a close associate of President Eisenhower and the then American Ambassador to the United Nations”.14
The star was in the ascendant for Soviet policy in the Middle East during the Suez crisis: as for Khrushchev, the crisis became his personal triumph. I give below my conversation with D. T. Shepilov, who was the then Soviet Foreign Minister and alternate member of the Presidium of the CPSU, and who was at the time perhaps the last survivor among the Soviet political leaders of that period. Certain details of our conversation have been retained largely because they characterize the attitudes of the Soviet participants in that historic drama and the general atmosphere of those days.15
D. T. SHEPILOV: The behaviour of the English and the French was high-handed. They began to use threats and ultimatums, and so on. After all the Suez Canal was built by Egyptians who worked themselves to the bone. I received a favourable impression of Nasser during my first trip, when I first met him. He was a very honest man who was really devoted to the Arab land and the Arab people. Once I was present at a rally. I’ll never forget it, there were hundreds of thousands of people. Nasser said in his speech “Should it be necessary, I’ll sacrifice everything, I’ll give my life’s blood, drop by drop, for the cause of liberation of the Arab peoples . . . . If Nasser doesn’t fulfil his promises – execute Nasser!” A hundred-thousand-strong crowd roared tumultuously. There was something mystic in all this. I felt how popular he was. He led a new group of people from different orders of society who came to power and wanted to make the country free from foreign domination. Among their major steps was the nationalisation of the Suez Canal. This was a fully lawful act. When strenuous and dangerous measures were taken by the West in response, we decided to avert an armed clash in the region. Our main political line was not to permit the eruption of an armed conflict in this very sensitive zone of the world. Incidentally, Khrushchev was a man of moods: now he says “Yes”, then he says “No”. So you could expect all sorts of surprises from him. I’ll tell you about an incident. When the London Conference of Canal Users was coming to an end, I suddenly received a coded telegram signed by Khrushchev and Bulganin. It said: “At one of the last press conferences make things hot for the imperialists, spike their guns . . . ” When it was all over, victory was ours. We found ourselves in agreement with India, Indonesia and Ceylon, and the Dulles proposals were not accepted. So I thought: “Why should I aggravate relations at a final press conference?” and I played things calmly. When I got back to Moscow, I telephoned Khrushchev. “Well”, he said, “come to my place”.

40 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
THE AUTHOR: Did he address you as “thou” or “you”? D. T. SHEPILOV: As “you” . . . From the beginning his attitude to me was very
good. He accepted my advice. He used to say, “Well, why do you ask me? Act on your own, take decisions yourself” on international and ideological issues. He used to look out for opportunities to meet me and he would raise all sorts of questions for discussion. It was interesting to be with him. He was a brilliant story-teller and he had an extraordinary memory. THE AUTHOR: Wasn’t he poorly educated? D. T. SHEPILOV: He was practically illiterate. He learned to read somehow but he wasn’t able to write. Yet he had a surprisingly great memory. He was a man of innate talent. However, we were able to observe the evolution of a man who possessed unlimited power. He developed a taste for power and began to do eccentric things: now he’s sending missiles to Cuba under the very nose of the United States, now he’s wanting maize to be sown far and wide, from Sukhumi to Yakutsk . . . He kept a jealous eye on everybody. Severe measures – even organizational ones – were taken against any minor objection. (“Organizational measures” meant in party jargon that a person was removed from his post – A.V.) Let us say that the Presidium of the Central Committee is in session. They begin to argue about the steel industry. Tevosyan tells him, “Nikita Sergeyvich, I know better than thou. After all, it’s me who has worked at Krupps”. Tevosyan was dismissed for this remark, then later on he was sent to Japan as an ambassador, and then he fell ill. In short, it was Bonapartism. He really made a mess of things . . . . Yet at the beginning he used to come round to my place almost every Sunday, either by himself, or with Nina Petrovna (Khrushchev’s wife – A.V.), or with all his family. We’d go for a walk and discuss problems. Well, after the London Conference, he asks me to come and he says: “Look here, why didn’t you carry out my and Nikolai’s orders? Why didn’t you hit the imperialists in the mug?”. I say to him: “Nikita Sergeyvich, there was no need. The Conference was a success, we won, the Egyptians retained the canal. Dulles’s plan to set up a Canal Users’ Association failed. So what was the point of aggravating relations? We have gained one thing, so why should we spoil the other? Why should we spoil relations with other countries, with the United States, for example? It wasn’t necessary”. He says: “Yes, indeed you are a dangerous man, you are very dangerous. Do you want to conduct foreign policy yourself?” I say: “I don’t want to conduct it myself. I know perfectly well who conducts the foreign policy here. Please understand me correctly, there was no need. Under the circumstances, I assure you, there was no need for any mug-hitting”. “No, no, no! You are a dangerous man. We appreciate your good work at the Conference, but we have also noticed that you didn’t follow our instructions”. By the way, there weren’t any “organizational measures” at that time. THE AUTHOR: At the time of the Conference, did you know that there were serious differences between the USA on the one hand and England and France on the other? D. T. SHEPILOV: Of course I did, and we understood the significance of these differences. The situation was tense, especially for the British. I flew to London

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 41
and arrived at the famous Downing Street, and ignoring the usual protocol, Eden came out to meet me. He was a very clever, charming and influential politician, although he did not sense in what directions events were developing. He said to me: “Mr Minister, please understand us. To give away the Suez Canal to the Arabs, especially to Nasser with his volatile personality, for us, for the British, it’s like . . . ” and he drew his hand across his neck. “This is what the Suez Canal means for Britain. Therefore I’d like you to understand why we react so strongly to Nasser’s standpoint on nationalising it”. I told him that they couldn’t react like that because it was Egyptian territory and the canal had been built by Egyptians, and that they had the right to nationalize it. I said that they could stipulate their conditions but nothing more. THE AUTHOR: Did you already know what measures the USSR could take to counteract the British and the French? D. T. SHEPILOV: From the very beginning I was firmly and categorically disposed never to allow the conflict to develop into armed clashes. As for Khrushchev, with his temperament and his volatility and his “We’ll make it too hot for them!”, he was able to do unusual things. But when a calm and sober dialogue began he had a good grasp of the whole thing. THE AUTHOR: The Soviet missile-nuclear ultimatum was a well thought-out bluff, wasn’t it? D. T. SHEPILOV: Of course. There was a firm decision not to bring the matter to the point of an armed conflict. However, I devised some measures of a psychological nature and carried them out. Let’s say, I summoned the French, British and Israeli ambassadors at night. Just think of it: it’s night-time, their eyes are red because they’re having a sleepless night, the situation is very unusual, my voice is grave, and I give them a warning. The Russian language is rich. The word “warning”, you know, doesn’t necessarily mean that we’re going to act. THE AUTHOR: But they weren’t sure about, were they? D. T. SHEPILOV: They were not sure. Very soon we felt that they were starting to find ways of getting out of this mess. Khrushchev’s extravagance also helped: “Who the hell knows what games he can play . .?” My policy was based on that. Of course we used the psychological factor extensively. But we always kept in mind that we would avert war by any means. THE AUTHOR: You weren’t alarmed by such a policy of brinkmanship, were you, because of the unpredictability of the other side’s reactions? What if the other side had decided on making a pre-emptive strike? D. T SHEPILOV: It would have been impossible at that time, mainly because of the American position. Britain didn’t have the guts to do it, and the Americans didn’t want to begin a war because of Britain. There were no serious or onerous reasons why the United States would unleash an armed conflict, and this played into our hands. THE AUTHOR: This scheme of yours shows that your calculation was correct. To confirm it, I’d like to mention a document which I found in the British archives, in which exactly the same idea is expressed: the emotional character of the new Russian leader created an element of unpredictability and miscalculation in case of a nuclear war.

42 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
D. T SHEPILOV: I also went ahead on the basis that there were grounds for believing that the USSR would be ready to interfere because of the apparently unbalanced personality of Khrushchev and a seeming lack of responsibility for every single word that he said (unlike his predecessors).
THE AUTHOR: Don’t you think that the success of the brinkmanship policy and then Khrushchev’s incorrect judgement of Kennedy following their meeting in Vienna propelled him into taking the adventurous step of deploying missiles in Cuba? Didn’t he act under the impression that he would have another Suez success?
D. T. SHEPILOV: I think you’re right. Of course, I wasn’t in politics at that time, because I had already been exiled to Kirghizstan. Kennedy dared to face conflict. He’d been a naval man in the past and he was a very resolute person, with a strong character.
THE AUTHOR: Do you think policy was defined mostly by Khrushchev, or by Bulganin?
D. T. SHEPILOV: Foreign policy with all its pluses and minuses was defined by Khrushchev, of course. Bulganin . . . He wasn’t a clever man at all. He was narrow-minded and ignorant. Looked at either subjectively or objectively, Khrushchev for all his extravagances sometimes had some grains of sense. Bulganin had neither initiative nor fresh ideas.
THE AUTHOR: And what about your predecessor V. M. Molotov? How highly do you rate him?
D. T. SHEPILOV: That’s a tough question. Molotov had been a member of the Party since its Second Congress; he’d worked with Lenin. He seemed to be an irreproachable man; he worked hard, day and night . . . . We didn’t know that he had been involved in Stalin’s crimes. He was reputed to be the second man after Stalin. I remember Stalin’s funeral. Georgi Alexandrovich Zhukov was standing nearby. He was holding a cushion with one of Stalin’s orders on it – all the marshals were carrying his orders and medals on little cushions. I went up to him and asked; “What do you think, who do you think will succeed him?”. He answered: “There’s nothing to think about. Judging by how things are going, Molotov – perhaps. You know what I think about him. Molotov is a rigid administrator; he can take harsh measures”. Even so, Khrushchev managed to be at the top.
After this, the 86 year-old ex-Minister, who had been a potential leader of my country, gave me his account of how he had found himself “together with” Molotov, Malenkov and Kaganovich in opposition to Nikita Khrushchev, and how he had lost his chance and also acquired the longest surname in the country – “AndAdjoined-to-Them-Shepilov”. But this is outside the scope of the present work.
Keith Kyle in his very voluminous work Suez: Britain’s End of Empire in the Middle East managed to reflect the reaction of the Western capitals to the Soviet ultimatum. In a letter to Ben-Gurion the Soviet leadership for the only time in the history called into question the very existence of the Jewish state. It was a cold shower for Tel Aviv. The French and the British received the following message:

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 43
“We are determined to crush the aggressors with the use of force and to restore peace in the East”. In a message to the US president the USSR offered to act together to prevent aggression, to which, of course, the USA responded negatively, but neither did it support its allies.
Anthony Eden’s councillors drew attention to the message in code from William Hayter, British Ambassador in Moscow, in which he argued that only a clear agreement of British and US positions “would stop these people (the Russians – A.V.) from committing dangerous acts of madness”. Many of his advisors shared these concerns. The fear of “real Soviet actions” in the Middle East was present. Douglas Dillak, American ambassador in Paris, was invited at 2 AM to Matignon, where Prime Minister Guy Mollet asked the ambassador what the US would do if Soviet missiles would come down on France. According to the ambassador, the members of the Cabinet present in Matignon “were scared to death”. Dillak answered that the United States would act in accordance with the NATO treaty, but in response to the wish of Guy Mollet to obtain a confirmation of this from Washington, he said that there were elections taking place in the US at that moment, so no response should be expected until a few hours later. Both Eden and Guy Mollet were ready for a ceasefire, but – to save face – “under US sponsorship” rather than under Soviet pressure. US intelligence reported from Moscow on a possible dispatch of volunteers to the Middle East and of the Soviet Air Force – to Syrian airfields.
The three aggressor states became completely isolated. By the morning of 6 November 1956 Egypt and Israel had already agreed on a ceasefire.16 Pound sterling was falling, pushed by the Americans, and the UK was facing bankruptcy. In the evening of 6 November, Paris and London, lacking the Washington’s support, agreed to a ceasefire.17
As early as 6 November 1956 Eden sent a message to the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers informing the Council that the British government had instructed its troops in Egypt to observe a ceasefire at midnight on 6 November. Guy Mollet, Chairman of the French Council of Ministers also sent a message to his Soviet counterpart stating that France would agree to a final ceasefire in Egypt as soon as Israel and Egypt had expressed a similar intention, and when the UN armed forces were ready to take on the duties that had been assigned to them. On 8 November a similar message was received from Ben-Gurion confirming that Israeli troops had agreed a ceasefire in Egypt.
Nothing succeeds like success, and the Soviet Union continued to score propaganda points. TASS noted in a statement of 10 November 1956 that the Soviet people would not be the passive spectators of international brigandage, and if the aggressors did not withdraw their troops from Egyptian territory in compliance with UN resolutions, the Soviet government “would not stop Soviet citizens from leaving for Egypt as volunteers if they wanted to help the Egyptian people to fight for their independence”.18 This was a minor bluff to add to the successful major one.
The stopping of military action against Egypt was attributed in the Arab countries to the position adopted by the USSR. The Syrian president in a telegram sent

44 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
on 6 November 1956 to the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet called it “the Soviet Union’s just, noble and bold stand against the barbarous and criminal aggression of the colonialist countries against Egypt has met with the warm approval of the Arab nation, which desires peace, freedom and sovereignty”. And the Chairman of the Jordanian House of Representatives commented similarly, in his telegram, that “your immortal decision to take political and military measures to curb such aggression, in compliance with existing UN principles, has assured you of the Arab world’s abiding friendship and acknowledgement”.19
The USSR chose to gloss over the demand of US President Eisenhower addressed to the three countries to cease hostilities and to withdraw from Sinai and from the Suez Canal zone.
The reaction of the British and French governments to the nationalization of the Suez Canal was without any doubt the last serious burst of imperial ambition, and represented a vain attempt to obstruct a historical process of winning or consolidating independence that was gaining momentum not only in the Arab East but throughout the entire Third World. The desire to seize the Suez Canal and to overthrow Nasser was not the sole reason why the leaders of Britain and France, with the collaboration of Israel, undertook this daring “triple aggression”. Britain hurled large forces into battle for the sake of preserving the British Empire at least at mid-1950s level. France fought in Egypt for Algeria and for the rest of its colonial empire in Africa. Israel fought with the aim of weakening the biggest and the most dangerous of the Arab countries as well as of returning to the Western bloc. But they lost the war over the Suez Canal politically as well as at the international level. Soon Britain and France withdrew their forces from the Suez Canal zone, while Israel – under the US pressure – withdrew from Sinai. Britain and France both lost the remnants of their colonial possessions shortly after.
During the 1950s and 1960s the tides of anti-Western nationalism in the Middle and Near East ebbed and flowed, causing some dissension in the region but being generally on the rise. While Moscow backed the Arabs against the West and (though not without reservations) against Israel, which in the eyes of the Arabs had become a symbol of “settler colonialism” and an “outpost of the West” in the region, the USSR’s influence was high and its prestige grew. The crises and mutual disillusion would follow later but for the time being relations generally were getting stronger and cooperation was expanding, although occasionally aggravated or interrupted by anti-communist repression or by ideological disputes which look rather ridiculous today.
The failure of Britain and France to maintain the West’s position in the region and the growth of Soviet influence and prestige sent a warning signal to the US administration and prompted the Americans to take action. On 5 January 1957, the theme of President Eisenhower’s address to Congress (labelled “the Eisenhower Doctrine”) was concerned with America’s policy in the countries of the Middle East. Describing the situation in the region as “critical” he demanded permission to employ American armed forces in the Middle East whenever he considered it necessary and without further application to Congress as required by the US Constitution. Aiming openly at the USSR, he also demanded full powers to grant

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 45
military and economic aid to the countries of the region, at the same time calling on the Arab countries to sever their relations with the Soviet Union and its allies.
The Soviet government reacted speedily. As early as 13 January 1957 a statement was issued in TASS in which the Eisenhower Doctrine was branded as “a crude interference in the internal affairs of the Arab countries” that contradicted the principles and goals of the United Nations and posed a “serious danger to peace and security in the Middle East”. It was further stated that the intentions of the Eisenhower Doctrine were evidently of a selfish character and were aimed at imposing “a regime of a martial protectorate” and at setting back “the development of these countries”. It was a “slanderous fabrication” to speak of a Soviet threat to the Arab countries since the Soviet Union was interested solely in “preserving peace in the Middle East region which is situated in direct proximity to its frontiers”, and in the consolidation by the countries of that region “of their economic and political independence”. The TASS statement further noted that the possibility envisaged by the Americans of using their armed forces in the Middle East could lead to “dangerous consequences for which the government of the United States would bear full responsibility”.20
On 11 February 1957 the Soviet government presented the draft of its “Basic Principles of the Declaration of the Governments of the USSR, the USA, Britain and France on Peace and Security in the Middle East and on Non-interference in the Internal Affairs of the Countries of This Region”. These principles were to include the following:
1 the preserving of peace by resolving conflicts solely by peaceful means on the basis of negotiations;
2 the non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the Middle East and respect for their sovereignty and independence;
3 the renouncing of any attempts to involve these countries in military blocs with the collaboration of the great powers;
4 the removal of foreign bases and withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of the countries of the Middle East;
5 the mutual repudiation of weapons supplies to the region.21
In evaluating the notes sent at the time by the Soviet government, it is clear that they included plenty of constructive elements which, if revised, ironed out and agreed upon, could certainly have strengthened peace and security in the Middle East; statements from the Americans were also full of positive ideas. However it is unlikely that Moscow or Washington had in mind anything more than actions performed in the spirit of the Cold War and gains in terms of propaganda, and given the atmosphere prevailing in Western capitals it was not surprising that J. F. Dulles rejected Soviet initiatives as a game intended to make the West recognize the USSR as a great power in the Middle East with its own agenda. One may also suppose that for as long as they were successfully capitalizing on anti-Western rhetoric and gaining serious political advances in the region, the Soviet leaders were not interested in genuine arrangements with the West that would tie their own hands.

46 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
In August 1957, the Syrian defence minister, Khalid al-Azm, signed an agreement on military and economic cooperation in Moscow. Following his return to Damascus three members of staff at the American Embassy were declared persona поп grata because of alleged involvement in a conspiracy aimed at restoring the pro-Western dictatorship of Adib Shishekli, which had been overthrown earlier. The anti-Mossadeq coup in Iran and the part played in it by the United States was still fresh in people’s minds, so that the claim that the American secret services had had a hand in an anti-Syrian conspiracy was accepted almost without question. Al-Azm then appointed Afif al-Bizri, noted for his pro-Communist sympathies, as Chief of his General Staff. This meant, in the opinion of Washington and other Western capitals, that the Communists were on the verge of taking over power in Syria, a view reinforced by diplomatic and intelligence reports from Beirut, Baghdad and Amman that grossly exaggerated the influence and strength of the Syrian Communists as well as the USSR’s ability to interfere in Syrian developments.
Eisenhower’s memoirs recorded the US administration’s consensus that the regime in Syria had to go in order to prevent an imminent Communist takeover there. Turkey concentrated its troops near the Syrian border, the US Sixth Fleet moved into the Eastern Mediterranean, and America started to send weapons into Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon. The USSR launched an intensive propaganda campaign against Turkey, the USA and the Baghdad Pact, and sent a series of harsh messages to the Turkish government. On 10 September 1957 the Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers sent a letter to the Turkish prime minister stressing that the USSR, because of the proximity of the Middle East region to its frontiers, could not neglect a development that might lead to conflict in the region, and appealing to the Turkish government not to participate in any armed intervention against Syria but to contribute to detente. The letter further warned that Turkey might be in for “serious troubles if it were guided by the advice of foreign circles that had little, if any, interest in maintaining peace in the Middle East”.22 The TASS statement on 19 October 1957 on the Middle East situation was in similar vein: the USSR appealed to the United Nations to intervene immediately “in order to preclude the possibility of war arising and raging around”, and affirmed that Syria, if attacked, would not stand alone because in such a situation the Soviet Union would “take all necessary measures to help the victims of aggression”.23 The tone of both Soviet and Western propaganda was becoming harsher. However, its threatening gestures notwithstanding, the USSR had no intention of intervening.
In September 1957 a Soviet navy squadron paid a friendly visit to Latakia. Towards the end of that month the Arab leaders who had intended to join the antiSyrian action gave up their adventurist plans, realizing that such a course would have been both unwelcome and also dangerous for them because of widespread popular anti-Western feeling. True, the Turkish card remained in the West’s hand but it was an extremely dangerous card to play both politically and militarily. As a friendly gesture Nasser airlifted Egyptian detachments to Syria on 13 October; on 24 October, Konstantin Rokossovski, a distinguished Soviet commander in World

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 47
War II, was put in charge of the Transcaucasian military district, and joint ground force and naval manoeuvres began in the Transcaucasia and Black Sea region. The crisis seemed to have reached its peak.
However, both the USSR and the USA were intent on avoiding a conflict. Nikita Khrushchev appeared unexpectedly at a reception at the Turkish Embassy in Moscow and stated that a peaceful solution to the question was desirable. The Western powers abandoned the idea of direct military intervention in Syria’s affairs, and the crisis began to subside.
In late October international pressure on Syria ceased, although the country’s domestic situation remained highly unstable with the balance of forces remaining unclear. Subsequently both the Syrian leadership and senior military officers, wary of the Communists, decided to join forces with Egypt, and on 1 February 1958 the two countries combined to form a unitarian state that was known as the United Arab Republic (UAR). This political process seemed to be directed towards strengthening Arab unity under the banner of Pan-Arabism and towards an eventual expansion of the newly created republic at the expense of other countries. The pro-Western regimes of Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon were very aware of this danger, and close cooperation between Iraq and Jordan was established by the Hashemite24 leaders of these two states. In Lebanon, where the Eisenhower Doctrine had been accepted in 1957, anti-Western and pro-Nasser sentiments ran particularly high and the country was on the verge of civil war.
American and British forces now began to concentrate on the Eastern Mediterranean region, and interventionist plans were under discussion that allowed for the possible involvement of the Iraqi army. In July 1958, Nuri Said, the Iraqi prime minister and uncle of the King, dispatched troops to Jordan to take part in a joint operation against Syria if Lebanon should be threatened. Instead the brigade, commanded by Abd al-Karim Qassem, entered Baghdad and overthrew the monarchy. Nuri Said was hanged and King Faisal II was killed. The Iraqi Republic was proclaimed on 14 July 1958 and shortly after Iraq withdrew from the Baghdad Pact (which later evolved into and was renamed CENTO). Nasser made a secret visit to Moscow.
In the meantime the Lebanese and Jordanian governments requested assistance and as early as 15 July American troops landed in Lebanon and British troops were airlifted to Jordan through Israeli airspace. Gamal Abdel Nasser who had just returned from Moscow went straight back again to try to discover Soviet intentions. But Khrushchev clearly had no intention of interfering, and his only reaction was to declare joint manoeuvres on the Turkish-Bulgarian border. Indeed, Soviet and American conduct in the Middle East was becoming something of a ritual. Statements were made and threatening behaviour was demonstrated, yet at the same time every measure was taken to avoid a direct conflict.
On 19 July 1958 Khrushchev sent political messages to the American president and the prime ministers of Britain, France and India, to the effect that the Soviet government refuted Western allegations about “interference by the UAR in the internal affairs of Jordan and Lebanon” and declared the actions taken against them to be “a gross violation of the UN Charter and an unprovoked aggression”.

48 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
Meanwhile it proposed the immediate convening of a summit conference, to be attended by the USSR, the United States, Britain, France and India, and by the UN Secretary General, that would take urgent steps to prevent a conflict. The agenda tentatively included, among other points, the ending of arms supplies to the Middle East.25 The Soviet government also censured and warned Turkey quite harshly for allowing its military base at Incirlik to be used by the US as a transshipment point for American troops being sent to Lebanon. The usual round of rhetoric, charges and countercharges, diplomatic notes and statements at the UN followed. The replies by the Western powers to Khrushchev’s proposals indicated a positive attitude but the extra conditions put forward by the West were rejected in Moscow. Neither side appeared ready to talk, nor were they making much effort to do so.
During the Lebanon-Jordan crisis the US and Britain demonstrated their readiness to take decisive action in support of their allies. The pro-Western governments continued to hold power in these two countries. The USSR demonstrated caution towards practical actions alongside a great variety of anti-Western political and propaganda moves, and won new supporters in the Arab world. British troops were withdrawn from Jordan on 2 October and US troops left Lebanon on 25 October 1958.
The formation of the UAR met with mixed feelings in Moscow. On the one hand, it seemed to strengthen the “anti-imperialist” (anti-Western) forces in the Middle East, yet on the other, Moscow had pinned great hopes on the leftist forces and Communists in Syria, who inspired greater confidence than did Nasser, whom the somewhat prejudiced Soviet leaders suspected of “petty-bourgeois nationalism”. As in Egypt, Nasser had demonstrated in Syria that he would not tolerate independent political organisations, including communist ones.
When the Lebanon-Jordan crisis came to nothing, the Communists set about expelling those who had opposed the entirely hypothetical merger of their countries with the UAR. Iraqi and Syrian Communists launched a fierce anti-Nasser campaign, to which Nasser reacted with a widespread anti-Communist and antiSoviet campaign through his mass media, followed by massive arrests of Communists in Egypt and Syria that made little distinction between his opponents and those who were prepared to cooperate with him. The Soviet Union responded rather reluctantly to the polemics of the Egyptian mass media. On 27 January 1959 Khrushchev stated in his report to the 21st Congress of the CPSU:
We Communists and all progressive forces naturally sympathise with those who are fighting for social justice. We do not deny that some UAR leaders have ideological differences with us. However, on questions of anti-imperialist struggle and of strengthening the political and economic independence of the countries who have already liberated themselves from colonialism and are striving against the danger of war, our position coincides with theirs.26
During January and February 196l Pravda printed information from the Italian Communist daily Unita claiming that the Egyptian authorities had arrested 200

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 49
Communists and sympathizers and deported them to a locality where 800 more “fighters for democracy” had been detained for several years.27 During May 1961 Pravda carried an article on the death of the Lebanese Communist leader Farajallah Helou, who had been arrested in Damascus and reputedly “tortured to death by the Egyptian secret police”28 and Soviet papers also quoted statements by international organizations who had urged the release of Mr Helou. Pravda also responded to anti-Communist attacks by Al-Ahram and Al-Musawwar in an article signed by “The Commentator”, (implying that publication had been approved by the international department of the Central Committee of the CPSU).29
However both countries soon learned that the interests bringing them together were more real than those dividing them. Iraq was not going to join the UAR, not because of the negative attitudes of the Iraqi Communists but because General Qassem himself was reluctant to give up his position as an independent dictator. In Syria, there was widespread and growing discontent with the results of the amalgamation with Egypt, especially among the upper and middle levels of the Syrian bourgeoisie following the application of Egyptian decrees on nationalization. In 1961, a group of dissatisfied senior officers carried out a coup d’état against Nasser and restored Syria to independence. This was a considerable blow to Nasser’s pan-Arab vision and to his personal dignity but he sensibly concluded that the Syrian plot had not been backed either by the Communists or by the USSR, and that he could therefore resume his pragmatic policy of cooperation with Moscow.
The Soviet leaders realized that they needed to rely on Egypt not only because of its key strategic importance and its position as the most influential country in the Arab world. Attempts to establish close cooperation with post-revolutionary Iraq had resulted in a great deal of bitterness and frustration in the Kremlin, and following the initial enthusiasm for Qassem’s regime, the Soviet leaders became anxious and concerned as relations with Baghdad developed less smoothly than Moscow had hoped and as the internal situation in Iraq continued to be unsettled. While the first anniversary of the revolution was being celebrated in Baghdad, there was bloodshed in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk where Kurds and Turkomans were engaged in fierce clashes that had obvious political causes. Local Communists (genuine or self-proclaimed) intervened to settle scores with their own political opponents (“reactionary elements”). In Mosul hundreds of Baathists were killed. The unrest was suppressed by Qassem with equal violence. The Communists and their allies engaged in political terrorism through revolutionary tribunals led by Colonel Mahdawi, convicting hundreds, if not thousands, of people and executing many of them, and the Iraqi dictator, fearing and distrusting the Communists, began to persecute them, sentencing a number of them to death. He also attempted to set up an alternative communist party as a way of weakening the support base of the genuine Communists who, even so, did not venture to oppose Qassem until towards the end of his regime.
The Communist terror in Iraq was never denounced, discussed with regret or even mentioned in the Soviet literature, possibly because both the Soviet leaders and the “idealist” Communists in Moscow were imbued with the notion of the

50 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
legality of the “red terror” or with memories of its “efficacy” at the time of the civil war in Russia. Perhaps, according to their way of thinking, violence as the “midwife of history” was demanding new sacrifices, which would naturally be offered in the form of “reactionaries” and “imperialist henchmen” for the sake of progress and the bright future. But Arab Communists paid dearly for the Iraqi massacres. Western and Nasserist propaganda seized every opportunity to liken Communists to executioners and murderers, as did the Iraqi mass media so that the reputation of the Communists remained tarnished for many years. Meanwhile the USSR continued to cooperate with Qassem’s Iraq.
In the context of the Gulf crisis of 1900–1991 it is useful to recall Moscow’s attitude towards Kuwait 30 years ago. Britain rescinded the 1899 protectorate treaty with Kuwait on 19 June 1961. Six days later Qassem declared Kuwait an inalienable part of Iraq, while the Saudi government insisted that Kuwait was part of Saudi Arabia. British troops arrived in Kuwait on 1 July at the request of the Kuwaiti Shaikh. On 6 July Qassem insisted that although “merger” or rather “reunion” remained his government’s official aim, this would be achieved by peaceful means, and the Soviet government played into Baghdad’s hands by opposing Kuwait’s admission to the United Nations. But when Qassem’s regime was overthrown on 8 February 1963 the USSR was quick to change its stance and on 7 May 1963 the Security Council agreed unanimously to admit Kuwait to the UN.
Qassem was raining blows in all directions but his regime was doomed since he had by now lost any social base. The spectre of another coup threatened and was not long in materializing. Many Soviet diplomats who were in Iraq at the time, as well as many Iraqi Communists, have argued that the Communists were strong enough to overthrow Qassem themselves, but it has never been made clear why they did not in fact do this. Possibly the USSR opposed this move, or else the Communists did not command sufficient support among the armed forces. In the event Qassem was overthrown by a Baath-dominated group; General Abd al-Salam Aref became president, General Ahmad Hasan al-Baqr, who was supported by the Baath Party,30 became prime minister, while the general secretary of the Iraqi wing of the Baath Party, Ali Saleh al-Saidi, became deputy prime minister, minister for home affairs and commander-in-chief of the so-called National Guard, the armed wing of the radical Baath faction. Colonel Saleh Mahdi Ammash held the defence portfolio.
The Baathist regime was recognized on 11 February 1963 by the USSR, the United States and Great Britain. The regime’s taking of power was swiftly followed by violence as Communists and Nasserists were seized en masse and killed, mainly by the National Guard, without any trials or investigations in a nightmare of arrests, torture and murder that spread through all levels of the society. The scale of the massacre was so broad that the Central Committee of the CPSU took the unusual step of publishing, on l6 February, a denunciation of the “bloody terror” against Iraqi Marxists and Communists. On 9 March the military governor General Rashid Mislih announced the execution of three Communist leaders – Salem Adil,

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 51
Muhammad Husain al-Ith and Hasan Uwaini. This provoked a mass demonstration in front of the Iraqi Embassy in Moscow on 14 March, accompanied by threats and window-smashing, at the time a rare kind of protest for Moscow that clearly reflected the Soviet leaders’ deep concern. In July two members of the Politbureau of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party – Jamal al-Haidari and Muhammad Saleh al-Abaji – were also executed.
At this time the Soviet Union was supporting the Kurdish revolt that had begun under Qassem. The Kurdish problem by itself was a sufficient lever to exert pressure on any Iraqi government in a case of emergency. However subsequent developments showed that the revolt had acquired its own dynamics and was now beyond Moscow’s control. On 16 June the USSR officially charged the Iraqi government with genocide against “the unprotected peaceful inhabitants of Kurdish villages and towns”, a policy that was “at variance with basic human rights and the UN Charter”31 and four days later Pravda carried an article entitled “Stop Crimes in Iraq” and signed by “The Commentator”.32 Towards the autumn of 1963 anti-Iraqi propaganda in the Soviet mass media began to acquire a harsh and unforgiving tone, although diplomatic relations with Iraq were retained.
Summer 1963 saw a profound split in the Baath as the more moderate elements and their temporary allies among the Nasserists and the Arab Nationalists transferred their support to Saidi. The success of the military coup led by General Abd al-Salam Aref was conditioned by the Baath’s three-way split into rival factions. Moscow greeted the coup with a sigh of relief, for although the new government was far from sympathetic to Communists, it did dissolve the National Guard. Khrushchev’s position was also facilitated as anti-Communist repression weakened and physical exterminations ceased. The Soviet government encouraged Baghdad and the Kurds to seek reconciliation, and in a telegram to Aref on 15 February 1964, Khrushchev applauded the ending of the “fratricidal war against the Kurds”.33
In the Maghreb, national liberation struggles in the French Protectorates led in 1956 to declarations of independence by Morocco and Tunisia, although their close ties with the West still persisted. Algeria’s bloody war against French domination continued, the Soviet Union supporting the provisional government of the Algerian Republic, and following Algeria’s declaration of independence and the consequent immediate and sharp deterioration in its relations with France, the USSR was the first to offer support to the government of Ben Bella, not least because of his declared allegiance to “the socialist choice”. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 but his successor Boumedienne also maintained close ties with the Soviet Union.
During the Khrushchev era the USSR cultivated strong economic and cultural relations with the Arab countries, based on its technological and economic capacity, and throughout the 1960s and 1960s agreements on economic and technical cooperation were concluded with Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, Yemen, Syria and the Sudan.

52 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
The Soviet Union’s cooperation with Egypt developed most dynamically with the USSR, as the single largest importer of Egyptian cotton, remaining for a number of years after 1956–1957 Egypt’s main trading partner. On 29 January 1958 both countries signed an agreement on economic and technical cooperation providing for Soviet assistance in the construction of more than 120 industrial and other projects that included an engineering plant at Helwan, an antibiotics and pharmaceuticals factory at Abu Zaabal, two oil refineries, a shipyard in Alexandria, a radio equipment plant in Cairo and so on. However, the major joint project was the Aswan High Dam. On 27 December 1958 the USSR and Egypt concluded an agreement concerning Soviet economic and technical assistance in the construction of the first part of the complex, followed by a similar agreement in August 1960 for the second part. The Aswan hydropower plant was the largest facility of its kind in Africa, and included a dam, a power station with a capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts, irrigation facilities and an artificial lake with a storage capacity of 130 billion cubic metres. The construction of the entire complex was completed in January 1971.
More or less immediately after Stalin’s death the new Soviet leaders had attempted to demonstrate their good will towards Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan. The main problem was Turkey. On 30 May 1953 the Soviet government sent Turkey a note proposing that the close relations that had existed between them in the 1920s should be restored and suggesting that existing differences should be discussed, also confirming that the USSR had “no territorial claims to Turkey”.34 It was a rare occasion indeed that previous Stalinist policy was openly admitted to have been wrong. However the Turkish leaders maintained their customary hostility towards the USSR and in spite of new advances by the Soviets who offered it credits and expanded trade and economic cooperation, Turkey joined the NATO alliance in 1959. After 1963, when anti-American sentiment was increasing and the scope of the US military presence was being curbed, there was a limited rapprochement between Turkey and the USSR.
Iran had also responded cautiously to Soviet proposals and had joined the Baghdad pact, ignoring Moscow’s displeasure. However, relations improved between them later on, as their interests began to coincide, and the Shah visited Moscow in June 1956, being received with due ceremony. The Shah’s statement in 1963 that he would not allow American missile bases in Iran led to a significant improvement in Iran’s relations with the USSR.
During the 1930s and 1940s Afghanistan had kept aloof from Moscow. However, during the 1950s the prime minister Mohammed Daoud agreed to receive Soviet arms in order to strengthen Afghanistan in its confrontation with Pakistan on the Pushtunistan issue and also because he wanted Soviet diplomatic support on the same matter. An economic cooperation agreement was signed on 27 January 1954 between the USSR and Afghanistan for a modest amount of $3.5 million, which was followed by a massive Soviet aid programme that assisted in the construction of irrigation projects and powerhouses, the development of ports along the Amu Darya river, the building of oil storage facilities and a polytechnic

institute in Kabul, as well as road construction and the modernization of airports. In the late 1950s Afghanistan became the third largest recipient of Soviet economic aid after India and Egypt, and its foreign policy could be described as being conducted to the full satisfaction of the Soviet Union.
To return to the Arab world, Iraq’s “anti-imperialism” and the USSR’s sympathies with Algeria did not prevent Egypt from retaining its position as the main bastion of Soviet policy in the Middle East as well as in Africa. Cooperation between the two countries became progressively closer, being crowned by Khrushchev’s protracted triumphal visit to Egypt for whose success Nasser had prepared by releasing most of the imprisoned Communists.
Khrushchev arrived in Alexandria on the Armenia on 9 May 1964 to be confronted by a euphoric crowd whose rapturous and emotional welcome far surpassed all conventional standards of courtesy. A foreign political leader could hardly remain indifferent to what was a most sincere reception from the Egyptians. In the eyes of many Khrushchev was the leader of a great country who had taken risks to stop the tripartite aggression against Egypt, who had supplied the Egyptian army with modern weapons and rendered enormous techno-economic assistance to enable Egypt to begin large-scale industrialization and who, last but not least, had agreed to help build the Egyptian dream – the Aswan High Dam. The Chinese prime minister Chou-En-Lai had been received as a guest by Egypt two months earlier and had been given the standard polite, but rather tepid, reception. Nasser had already gambled on Khrushchev and had no intention of annoying him by fraternizing with his Chinese rival.
Nasser presented Egypt’s highest decoration – the Order of the Nile – to Khrushchev who reciprocated by presenting Nasser and Marshall Abd al-Hakim Amer with Orders of Lenin and then awarding them both the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, to their considerable embarrassment and the displeasure of the Soviet public. The only non-Communist leader to whom this great honour had ever previously been given was Ahmad Ben Bella of Algeria. The present author was told by Anatoly Gromyko: “Khrushchev did not seek my father’s or anybody else’s advice on this matter”.35 On 13 May 1964 Khrushchev and Nasser simultaneously pressed the button that blew up the cofferdam and diverted the waters of the Nile into a drainage canal. It was the beginning of a new stage of constructing al-Sadd al-a’li, the Aswan High Dam.
The Soviet leaders must have found Nasser impressive and Khrushchev was certainly attracted by his personal charisma, his tact and his ability as a politician. He became a valuable champion of the USSR in foreign policy, both in the Arab world and in Africa and in non-Arab Asia. When a revolution coordinated with Egypt broke out in Yemen in 1962 and the new regime was threatened by the Saudi-supported monarchists, Nasser sent military forces to assist the republicans. Egypt was among the stalwarts of the Non-aligned Movement and the Organization of African Unity, and Cairo attracted many anti-Western Arab and African revolutionaries. Nasser banished or “Egyptianized” foreign capital, nationalized the property of the upper and middle bourgeoisie, carried out two land reforms,

54 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
imposed a 50 percent quota for “workers and peasants” in government bodies and adopted a Charter for National Action that included many formulations close to Soviet ideological stereotypes. Pravda wrote glowingly on the eve of Khrushchev’s visit that
the powerful revolutionary forces of our time – the world socialist system with its growing strength, the proletarian struggle in the capitalist countries and the national liberation movement – are merging in a single stream and delivering decisive blows to the system of imperialism and colonialism. The unity of these forces, their continuous strengthening and development are firm guarantees of building a new world with no room for wars or for the exploitation of man by his fellow men.36
Nasser was admirable in every respect, but . . . His only shortcoming was that, unlike Fidel Castro, he had failed to embrace “scientific socialism” and to become a Marxist. Had he done so there would have been total harmony and concord in Soviet-Egyptian relations. The primitive Messianic ideal still persisted in Khrushchev’s mind, occasionally surfacing in his speeches. At a youth rally in Cairo he admired “the freedom-loving Egyptian people” who had risen successfully “against capitalist exploitation”, adding that
Socialism is the only path that allows us to rid ourselves of deprivation and backwardness within a short historical span and that ensures a free and happy life to all who toil. I want you, the young citizens of the UAR who are setting out on the path of socialist construction, to achieve great success along that path.37
Official Nasserist propaganda had already begun to describe Egyptian society as socialist, while the distinguished guest held that the developing countries had only “started along the path of socialist construction”, i.e. that they had taken only the first steps in that direction. How could they, including Egypt, proceed further? Naturally by following the Soviet model. Mentioning the “accomplishments of the land of the Soviets”, such as the nationalization of industry and the collectivization of agriculture, Khrushchev concluded sincerely that, thanks to these achievements, Russia had been transformed from an economically backward country into a strong socialist power. The long and the short of it was: follow us along “the only true path”.38
At Aswan Khrushchev was displeased by the speech given by the Iraqi president Abd al-Salam Aref, with its emphasis on Arab nationalism and Islam, and in replying he departed from his prepared text to speak his mind. He asserted that the USSR had no intention of helping “the Arabs in general” but had come to the aid of the Egyptian people “who had engaged in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism . . . so that the working classes, the peasants and the struggling intelligentsia as well as all the progressive forces of the nation could forge ahead in building a new life”. It was the application of Leninist philosophy that had

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 55
won victory in the Soviet Union and would ultimately win victory “in many other countries”. To him the notion of Arab unity meant “the fraternal unity of all Arab workers and of all working people against imperialists and exploiters, colonialists and monopolies, and the victory of the working people”. Essentially he proposed to replace the “Arabs, unite!” slogan by saying that “Arab workers, Arab peasants, progressive Arab intellectuals and all labouring peoples shall unite in the struggle for freedom and independence, for a better life, and for their rights against national and foreign exploiters”. There would be room in such unity for Russians and for people of other nationalities, and for “all those who subsist on their own labour, and who fight for freedom, for a better life and for people’s happiness”.39
Nasser’s reply to the guest was mild in tone, though he repeated his thoughts on Arab unity. The slogan was “something other than a racist one”, for it reflected a profound historical reality, namely that the Arabs had always been a united nation characterized by “unity of material subsistence, their common awareness and a common world outlook”.40
Towards the end of the visit, the Egyptians had arranged a restful day’s fishing near Suez for Khrushchev, Nasser, Ben Bella and Aref. However little fishing was done from the yacht Hurriyya, as Khrushchev became involved in an emotional clash with the Arab leaders on nationalism and religion. Here the present writer quotes an incident recounted to him by the late Oleg Kovtunovich, interpreter, diplomat, man of letters, numismatist and collector of Egyptian antiquities:
KOVTUNOVICH: Both Khrushchev and his associates in the Soviet leadership considered that the Arab leaders were “going mad” on religion. That’s why Khrushchev decided to educate them. With this in mind he said to his companions on the yacht: “I remember a priest that we had in our village. He had a mistress. Well, he killed her and dismembered her corpse. Now, you see where religion and belief in God can bring a man”. His fellow leaders were a bit confused by this. Then Nasser said mildly, “Well, probably this case has nothing to do with religion. There are good and bad priests, I think. Probably there are even some Communists who may commit crimes . . .” Khrushchev suddenly felt hurt, and said: “Well, I see. One’s own shit smells of raspberries!”, making me rack my brains over how to convey the essence of this rustic proverb.41
Nevertheless the results of Khrushchev’s visit seemed extremely positive to both parties. Notwithstanding his emotional outbursts, the Soviet leader approved of the principles of Arab nationalism and accepted Nasser’s right to build Egyptian society according to his own judgment. He enthusiastically supported Nasser’s demand for the withdrawal of foreign military bases from the region, denounced Israel as an “imperialist base”, and backed the Arab position on the question of Jordanian water rights. Egypt had shown itself to be an important component of the “national liberation movement” that was to strike against “imperialism” – i.e., against the

anti-Soviet West – and cooperation with Egypt was in keeping with both the Messianic and the pragmatic aims of the Soviet leadership that were now starting to merge into a single strand.
Khrushchev’s generosity was not confined to the two golden stars of the Heroes of the Soviet Union that he had given to the Egyptian leaders. He also promised them a long-term loan of a quarter of a billion roubles for economic development purposes, and the concrete proposals for this were agreed when the Egyptian prime minister Ali Sabri visited Moscow that September. The USSR undertook to cooperate in constructing a steel plant at Helwan with an annual output of more than a million tons, a thermo-electric power station near Alexandria with a capacity of 200,000 kilowatts and an oil-processing plant in Suez.
Nikita Khrushchev was overthrown as the result of a “quiet conspiracy” among a majority of Politbureau members on 14 October 1964. Discontent with his rule was generated mainly by internal factors. The Party apparatus strongly opposed his attempts to weaken its grip on the society, the covert Stalinists were unhappy about the disclosure of the excesses of the Stalinist period, the masses were sick of Khrushchev’s voluntarist experiments and the intellectuals were alarmed by his growing authoritarianism and shocked by his ill-mannered rantings during his meetings with writers, artists and so forth.
However, let us do justice to Khrushchev. His policy was a combination of extremely naive Messianism and political pragmatism. He seemed to cherish the hope of seeing all races – white, black and yellow – marching under the crimson banners of Communism; yet his actions both in the Arab world and throughout the entire Third World were usually very skilful, combining resoluteness with caution and bumpkin-like obstinacy with the wisdom of a statesman. It must be noted that, in addition to other things, Khrushchev was simply lucky, until his fall. This was not simply because, as noted elsewhere, his political course was in line with the general direction of the historical process in the Third World and particularly in the Middle East. He acted as the leader of a great country that appeared to be building up its industrial potential faster than the West. And as its industrial potential grew, so did the Soviet Union’s giant military machinery and its military strength. The possibilities for extensive economic development had not yet been exhausted and the country’s natural wealth seemed to be boundless. Although the USSR had begun to import wheat, its agriculture did not seem overstrained, the total ineffectiveness of the “administrativecommand system” had not yet revealed itself, and timid attempts at economic reform had been suppressed. The West was only just entering the post-industrial society of informatics, computers and high-class services – and the qualitative gap between Western and Soviet societies did not become obvious until the 1970s or 1980s.
During the Khrushchev period, Soviet-Arab economic and cultural ties developed further, facilitated by the growing technical and economic potential of the Soviet Union. In the 1950–1960s the Soviet Union signed agreements on economic and technical cooperation with Egypt and Algeria (the provisional

The rise and fall of Khrushchev 57
government of the Algerian Republic) in 1958, Iraq (1959), Yemen (1956), Syria (1957) and Sudan (1963).
Cooperation with Egypt was the most dynamic. The volume of trade between the two countries in 1965 tenfold exceeded the level of 1953. From 1956–1957 and for many years the USSR was the main trading partner of Egypt, being the largest buyer of its cotton. On 29 January 1958 the countries signed the SovietEgyptian agreement on economic and technical cooperation, which provided for Soviet assistance in the construction of more than 120 industrial and other facilities in Egypt. The output of Helwan Iron and Steel Works, expanded with the help of the USSR in the 1970s, reached 1.5 million tons of steel per year. The Soviet Union helped to construct a machine tools factory in Helwan, a pharmaceutical factory in Abu Zaabal, two refineries, a shipyard in Alexandria and a radio engineering plant in Cairo.
The focus of cooperation was on Aswan High Dam. On December 27, 1958 an agreement was signed on the provision by the Soviet Union of economic and technical assistance for the construction of the first stage of the dam, and in August 1960 – of its the second stage. Aswan hydro scheme is the largest hydro-technical structure in Africa. The complex includes a dam, a hydroelectric power station with the capacity of 2.1 million KW, a two-thousand-kilometre high-voltage transmission line, the associated irrigation facilities and a water reservoir with the capacity of 130 billion cubic meters. The construction of the Aswan hydro scheme was completed in January 1971.
In Iraq, the Soviet Union started the construction of an agricultural machinery plant, tractor assembly plant and a plant for the production of electric motors and power transformers, and later facilitated the development of the nationalized oil fields in North Rumaila. Iraq built the Baghdad-Basra 750-kilometre railroad with the assistance of the Soviet Union. Syria began to build the Aleppo-LatakiaQamishli 737-kilometre railroad. Yemen built the seaport of Hodeidah with the help of the USSR.42
Many thousands of Arab specialists and military personnel were trained with the help of Soviet specialists locally or at universities and secondary specialist schools in the USSR.
Cultural cooperation – exchange of artists, actors, athletes – was carried out on a smaller scale, but quite successfully. In 1959, the Higher Institute of Ballet was established in Cairo, where Soviet ballet masters taught the courses. By the mid1960s the first Egyptian ballet company had been founded.
Within the first few months following the death of Stalin, the Soviet leadership began to make goodwill gestures towards Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan. Turkey, which in 1952 had joined the NATO, was the most difficult. The Soviet note dated 30 May 1953 already expressed the desire to renew the good relations that had existed since the 1920s and to hold negotiations to discuss the existing differences. The note stated that the Soviet Union had “no territorial claims towards Turkey”, and it was a rare example of public recognition of the fact that the former Stalin’s policy had been wrong. However, the inertia

58 The rise and fall of Khrushchev
of animosity of Turkish leaders towards the Soviet Union remained for a few years, even though the Soviet leadership continued to make advances, offering loans and expanding trade and economic cooperation. Since 1963 Turkey began to move gradually towards a limited rapprochement with the USSR. In Turkey, the anti-American movement was gaining strength and the American military presence was decreasing.
Iran, too, reacted cautiously to the Soviet proposals and joined the Baghdad Pact, ignoring Moscow’s displeasure. Interests of the two countries led to improved relations, and in June 1956 the Shah visited Moscow, where he was received with great pomp. A notable improvement took place after 1963, when the Shah said that he would not offer Iranian territory for US missile bases.
In the 1930s–1940s Afghanistan kept a distance from Moscow. But in the 1950s, Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan decided to obtain Soviet weapons to strengthen the army to resist Pakistani pressure; he counted on Soviet support for Pashtunistan problems. On 27 January 1964 Kabul and Moscow signed an agreement on economic cooperation with a small amount – 3.5 million US dollars. This was followed by Soviet aid in the creation of irrigation projects, power plants, development of ports on the Syr Darya River, construction of oil storage tanks and Kabul Polytechnic University, expansion of roads, modernization of airports. At the end of the 1950s, Afghanistan ranked third among the “non-socialist countries” after India and Egypt among the recipients of Soviet economic aid. Supposedly, its foreign policy fully satisfied the Soviet leadership.
The balance sheet of Khrushchev’s Middle East policy seemed favourable. He had managed to neutralize the Arab countries and Afghanistan very effectively by helping them to strengthen their independence. British colonialism in the Arabian Peninsula was on its last legs, and foreign bases were disappearing from Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and the Sudan. Although on a limited scale, Egypt and Syria (and to some extent also Iraq) became Soviet allies.
Nasser is reported to have said, on hearing of Khrushchev’s removal, “We have to begin everything again from scratch”.43 Other Arab leaders seem to have echoed that conclusion with sighs of distress. However, neither they nor Khrushchev’s successors had to begin the game again from the beginning. They simply continued the previous line and the previous relations. That the contradictions inherent in that line deepened and began in less than a decade to tear apart the fabric of Soviet-Arab relations, is another matter. Socio-political and economic conditions were changing throughout the world – in the West, in the USSR and in the Middle East – and Soviet economic resources were decreasing both absolutely and relatively. The destructive confrontation between the USSR and the USA was superimposed on all other ties and relations, causing damage to both sides, but primarily – to the Soviet Union.

The era of Leonid Brezhnev
After the fall of Nikita Khrushchev, there was no change in Soviet policies in the Middle East region. The logic of confrontation with the United States prompted Brezhnev and his associates to seek rapprochement with anti-Western regimes, while the idea of “undermining imperialism from behind” implied support of those who borrowed certain elements of the Soviet socio-economic model and who pursued the course of “socialist orientation”, as it was called in Moscow. The country’s internal security interests demanded “normalization of relations” and “good neighbourliness” with the northern sector countries, as well as the targeting of political and propaganda efforts at the military alliances in the region in which the West participated, as well as at foreign military bases. The strategic danger arising from the presence of the US Navy in the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean also prompted the Soviet leaders to take reciprocal measures of a military and strategic nature.
Cooperation with Egypt remained the cornerstone of Soviet Middle Eastern policy. In October 1964 Nasser received assurances from the new Soviet leadership that their policy towards Egypt would not change and that it would accord with the spirit of peaceful coexistence: high-level delegations were then exchanged. Both parties were attempting to establish personal contacts, and following the official visit made by Nasser to the Soviet Union from 27 August to 1 September 1965 he seemed to have found a common language with the new leaders. Cairo’s inclusion of former Egyptian Communists into the official power structure also helped to create a favourable background for Soviet-Egyptian cooperation. A Soviet delegation led by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, A. N. Kosygin, was received in Egypt from 10 to 18 May 1966.
In the 1950s and 1960s Syria, another country of great importance for the USSR, was prompted by domestic socio-economic considerations to adopt an anti-Israel as well as an anti-Western stand thereby creating a base from which it could expand its cooperation with Moscow. The Syrian Baathist version of Arab nationalism and socialism offered plenty of points of contact with Soviet policy as well as opportunities for dialogue and mutual understanding with the Soviet leaders, while its strategic position made it an important partner for the USSR. The coup of 23 February 1966, when the left-wing Baathist faction led by Nureddin Atasi came to power, accelerated Syria’s rapprochement with the Soviet Union.

62 Up the down staircase
Soviet arms supplies were increased,1 and a joint project was agreed for the construction of the Euphrates Dam, the political equivalent of Egypt’s Aswan Dam, which provided for the irrigation of 1.5 million feddans of arable land and the construction of a large hydroelectric power station. West Germany had originally promised to participate in such a project, but when Damascus severed diplomatic relations with Bonn in 1965 in protest against the German Federal Republic’s recognition of Israel, a new sponsor for the proposed scheme became necessary and the Soviet Union agreed to take it on. Unhappily the Syrian leaders had failed to anticipate the need to agree with Iraq and Turkey on the distribution of the waters of the Euphrates which later created serious problems for Syria’s relations with its neighbours.
The leaders of Syria and the USSR established initial contacts during January 1967. Moscow adopted a somewhat romanticized approach to the Syrian Baathists, hoping that they would evolve in the “correct” (i.e. “Soviet”) direction. However, for most individuals, including many of the army officers who took part in Syria’s consecutive coups, the socialist verbiage was regarded as no more than a dispensable tool in the struggle for power and for personal enrichment. The “Socialist ideals” and the radicalism of the Soviets were mistrusted in the Arab world, while the affiliation of many Baathist-minded officers with the Alawiyya sect2 aroused suspicion that their real motives had nothing to do with nationalism or socialism.
Largely for domestic policy reasons and to consolidate their power, Syria’s ruling circles manufactured an artificial crisis-like atmosphere by intimidating the public with threats of military provocation by “Zionists, imperialists and reactionaries” and by attempting to engender a “siege mentality” in the population. Certainly there were genuine conspiracies among external forces, as well as attempted coups, but this beleaguered atmosphere, sometimes hysterical and often sustained by the Soviet media, prompted the Syrians to raise the level of confrontation with Israel. Palestinian guerrillas made forays against Israel from Syrian territory, and there was considerable friction with Israel over the distribution of the water of the River Jordan.
As far as the Soviet Union supported the Arab confrontation with the West (though without pushing things to the point where it might itself have become involved in a conflict), and in its attempts to strengthen the Arabs’ independence, armed forces and economies, Soviet policy had clear-cut parameters and was rather fruitful. However the more Moscow became involved in regional affairs, the more it had to reckon with local factors and sources of conflict that frequently put the Soviet leaders into awkward positions. More influence – more involvement – more headaches! This kind of situation was quite familiar to the region’s former imperial masters – Britain and France – and to the now dominant power, the United States, and the Soviet Union could hardly expect to avoid it. The result was that Soviet weaponry was used by the belligerent parties in Yemen to wage their civil war, by the Baghdad government to suppress the Kurds and to threaten Kuwait, and by Khartoum to combat the rebels in Southern Sudan. The USSR manoeuvred skilfully enough between the Arab countries and prudently

Up the down staircase 63
refrained from siding with any of them in their mutual confrontations although, because of quirks in the formation of its foreign policy, Moscow’s stake in Egypt predisposed it to view events through Egyptian eyes.
After Syria’s departure from the United Arab Republic in 1961 its relations with Egypt were cool enough to place the Soviet leaders in rather a difficult situation, although the foreign policy interests of both countries were increasingly in accord. Soviet efforts were concentrated on rapprochement with Syria and A. N. Kosygin managed to achieve a reconciliation between Damascus and Cairo, agreed in December 1966.
Soviet priorities in the central Middle East conflict – that between the Arabs and Israel – were distorted from the very start. Though they recognized Israel’s right to exist, the Soviet leaders considered it to be an “imperialist base” in the region, so that the Arabs’ efforts to strengthen their armed forces against an eventual Israeli attack were treated as quite legitimate by Moscow. Had not Israel demonstrated its role and its intentions during the Suez crisis (or in Soviet terminology, die “tripartite aggression against Egypt”) in 1956? Yet Israel considered that the growing military potential of neighbouring nationalistic and often extremist regimes jeopardized its very existence. Had not the Arab rulers supported the call by the then Palestinian leader Ahmad Shukeiri tо “throw the Jews into the sea”? It is a purely academic question as to which came first, egg or hen? or who began the arms race, Arabs or Israelis? The arms race escalated on such a scale that by the 1980s the Middle East had become a region comparable to NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries in terms of concentration of armaments. Even in the latter part of the 1960s competition was intense enough.
In explaining Soviet cooperation with the Arabs, Soviet propaganda preferred to ignore the fact that the Arab-Israeli conflict had originated from the collision of two cases of nationalism and from the dispute between two peoples – the Israelis and the Palestinians – over one piece of territory. The Palestine problem was to acquire greater prominence later, during the 1970s and 1980s.
The defeat that turned into success
On the eve of the 1967 war the Soviet leaders were convinced that during the 11 years since the 1956 war, and thanks to their assistance, the Egyptian and Syrian armies had been sufficiently well-equipped for any eventual conflict. Soviet estimates of the balance of forces – the amount of armaments and the numeric strength of both armies, the boundless demographic potential of the Arab world, and the naive conviction that the Jews “did not know how to wage wars” which Israel’s previous military campaigns had failed to demolish – all fostered a relaxed attitude towards the coming military conflict: the Arabs would not be allowed to destroy Israel but it would be useful to shake them up a bit. It would be better to avoid war but if it was to begin, it should be limited and not lead to the Arabs’ defeat.
The present writer has been told that intelligence reports from Israel concerning the true operational readiness of the opposing armies and Israel’s plans for

64 Up the down staircase
the military campaign were simply discarded as misinformation. To believe these warnings would have been to doubt the wisdom and political insight of the Soviet leaders and to have questioned the many long years of work by the military agencies in Egypt and Syria just at the time when Leonid Brezhnev needed the support of the military command to strengthen his own position domestically. There is a Russian proverb that says “A peasant never crosses himself until it thunders”. Well, now it had thundered.
The Israeli leaders appear not to have opposed a military solution, possibly they even longed for it as they regarded the climate to be favourable for launching a war. The naive confidence of the Arab leaders in the strength and operational readiness of their armed forces reduced their vigilance and hindered practical measures for combat training and mobilization. A considerable part of the Egyptian army – some 70,000 men – was tied up in the civil war in Yemen, fighting with the republicans against the monarchists who were supported by the Saudis and by arms supplies from the West. Rivalry within the highest ranks of the Syrian military-political hierarchy made it doubtful whether the Syrian leaders would be able to exert effective authority. The USSR itself had already excluded the nuclear bluff from its arsenal as a result of the Cuban missile crisis and did not yet possess the capacity or the means necessary to transfer troops rapidly to the conflict zone. The strategic advantage seemed all too obvious to the Israeli leaders. At that time many took the concept of “strategic depth” seriously, and occupation of Arab lands would increase the extent of the territory under Israel’s control and enable it to strengthen its positions on the Golan Heights, the West Bank and in Sinai. It is difficult now to say whether Israel had intended to annex completely or in part East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights and to colonize them for immigrant settlers, or whether the Israeli leaders were ready for a solution based on the “peace for territories” formula. The overthrow of the nationalist, anti-Western and anti-Israel regimes in Syria and Egypt and their replacement by moderate governments ready for peace and compromise would of course have suited the Israelis.
The United States, entangled in the Vietnam war, had no objection to an Israeli strike on its Arab neighbours, and the US administration was aware of the real correlation of forces and operational readiness of the protagonists. The task of ousting the Soviet Union from the Middle East was never off America’s political agenda, and it was in Washington’s interests if a blow could be struck against the USSR’s prestige and standing by defeat of its Arab allies and friends and an eventual change of regime in Egypt and Syria. Nasser’s adventurist moves, coordinated with those of Syria, gave the Israelis the desired excuse for an attack.
Early in 1967 the Syrians’ anti-Israeli propaganda, which was prompted largely by domestic policy considerations, was increasingly being combined with military demonstrations along the ceasefire lines.3 The anti-Syrian rhetoric of the Israeli leaders was also accompanied by threatening military manoeuvres, (whose extent may have been overstated by Syrian intelligence and the Soviet mass media), and the Israeli leaders made a series of belligerent statements. A high-ranking Israeli source was quoted as saying that if Syria continued its sabotage campaign in

Up the down staircase 65
Israel there would be immediate military action to overthrow the Syrian regime.4 On 18 May 1967 Nasser demanded the withdrawal of United Nations troops from the ceasefire line and from the Straits of Tiran. He positioned Egyptian troops there on 23 May and banned Israeli ships from passing from the Bay of Aqaba to the Red Sea, thereby blockading the Israeli port of Eilat. As Laqueur notes, “The Soviet leaders no doubt wanted a show of Egyptian strength on Israel’s southern frontier; but did they want the closure of the Straits of Tiran and the war? The evidence is conflicting . . . Nasser had taken the first step without asking the Soviet Union. And then, at a certain point, retreat became impossible”.5
There is no indication that any of the Soviet leaders wanted a war in the Middle East. But they were compelled to support the Arabs morally and politically and it was clear from the Soviet government’s statement on 23 May 1967 that Moscow would be on the side of the Arabs if the latter were attacked.6 Even so there were hints to Nasser that the Soviet Union would not support the launch of hostilities against Israel. While supporting Nasser politically, Soviet diplomacy sought to elaborate a “mutually acceptable and just peaceful solution” to the crisis.7 As far as Soviet strategic interests were concerned it made no difference who controlled the Straits of Tiran and whether or not Israeli ships could sail there. The USSR was therefore ready to support any compromise solution, considering that it was not permissible to start a war simply because a few ships were unable to sail from Aqaba to the Red Sea.
Moscow did not control Egypt or Syria, but simultaneously the USSR at that moment did not consider that it could exert pressure on the UN over a resolution that was unacceptable to Nasser, concerning a return to the status quo ante in case this humiliated and antagonized Moscow’s key ally in the Middle East. Nor did Washington indicate any strong desire to cooperate in the search for a political solution. The Soviet mass media indulged in some extremely clumsy exercises, including reports that Syria was being threatened by some sort of joint invasion by Israel and Jordan directed by the CIA and oil magnates.8 In the meantime, King Hussein of Jordan was signing a mutual defence treaty with Nasser, on 30 May, and joining the anti-Israeli coalition. He then became embroiled in the war with Israel and as a result lost East Jerusalem and the entire West Bank.
In the first two days of the war that began on 5 June 1967 the Soviet press and radio carried Arab reports which had been prepared in advance and which claimed that Egyptian and Syrian troops were advancing deep into Israeli territory and that Arab air forces were attacking targets inside Israel. When it became clear on the second day that the Arabs’ air forces had been completely destroyed and that their ground forces had suffered a catastrophic defeat, the USSR was not prepared to interfere militarily in the conflict. As expected it began political and propaganda activities in support of the Arab countries. In a special statement on 5 June the Soviet government denounced “Israel’s aggression”, declared its “resolute support” for the governments and peoples of the Arab countries, and urged Israel to “cease hostilities immediately and unconditionally and withdraw its troops behind the ceasefire line”9 as the first urgent step. A similar draft was proposed to an emergency meeting of the Security Council by the Soviet representative N.

Fedorenko, but the American and British representatives objected to the inclusion in the resolution of a clause concerning troop withdrawal.
“Despite the obvious fact that the Soviet Union and the United States supported opposing parties in the 1967 war, both superpowers sought to prevent this war from escalating into a global confrontation”, wrote Y. Primakov.10 “There was in place a direct ‘hotline’ between the leaders of the two countries”.11
Soviet Ambassador in Washington A.F. Dobrynin wrote,
In the course of the decisive events President Johnson with Rusk, McNamara and principal advisers were constantly in the ‘Situation Room’ of the White House. In the Kremlin, the Politburo was in permanent session. The ‘hotline’ played an invaluable role in maintaining constant contact between Moscow and Washington, it allowed the White House and the Kremlin to keep abreast of developments and to prevent the dangerous ambiguity of intentions and actions of both governments.12
However, on 6 June the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution appealing to all the governments concerned to take as a first step and without delay all measures necessary for an immediate ceasefire and cessation of hostilities in the Middle East. However the Israeli offensive continued.
On 7 June the Security Council reconvened, at the request of the Soviet representatives, to fix the exact time at which hostilities should stop, unanimously agreeing that this should be at 8.00 p.m. GMT the same day.
Jordan accepted the ceasefire proposal on 7 June and on 8 June the Egyptian government informed U Thant, the UN Secretary General, that it had agreed to a ceasefire provided the other party would follow suit. However, this agreement did not have a clause on a return to the status quo ante.
On 8 June the Soviet government issued a new statement warning Israel that unless the demand for an immediate ceasefire was implemented, as required by the UN, the USSR would review its relations with Israel and consider whether or not to sever diplomatic ties.13 The Security Council was told by U Thant on 9 June that Egypt, Syria and Jordan had agreed to cease hostilities. However, Israeli forces continued their land and air operations along the front line against Syria, and although the Security Council demanded for the third time that hostilities should end immediately, Israel continued its offensive into Syrian territory and also bombed Damascus.
At the Security Council meeting on 10 June the Soviet representative appealed for urgent and resolute measures to “stop the aggressor and condemn him with the whole gravity of international law”,14 but the US delegate, though appealing to both parties for a ceasefire, was opposed to condemning Israel. The USSR then severed diplomatic relations with Israel on 10 June, announcing that unless hostilities stopped immediately, the Soviet Union and other “peace-loving” countries would “apply sanctions to Israel with all the consequences that would ensue”.15 Moscow also warned Washington via the hotline that unless Israel ceased hostilities the Soviet Union would not rule out the use of military action.16

Israel ceased hostilities on all fronts on 10 June, three hours after the receipt of the Soviet note, the country’s leaders having completed the military-strategic task they had set themselves. They may have hoped to expand the occupation zone even further in order to acquire more bargaining cards: however, while the breaking of diplomatic relations with Israel by the Soviet Union and most East European countries exhausted the arsenal of weapons of political pressure, it also created a state of uncertainty since future Soviet reactions would be difficult to forecast. The Israeli leaders therefore stopped, Washington too having apparently decided that it was imprudent to provoke the USSR into unforeseeable actions when Israel had already achieved success and could now go calmly away – to reap the political fruits.
To which extent did Israel count on the support of the USA when starting a war? The decision was taken by the Israeli leadership itself, which was confident of success, but it counted on Washington in case of complications. Washington was interested in serving a blow to the prestige and positions of the Soviet Union, which was an inevitable result of the defeat of its Arab allies and friends, and such a result could possibly be followed by regime change in Egypt and Syria. The task to oust the Soviet Union from the Middle East remained on the agenda of US policy.
US President Lyndon Johnson in his memoirs claimed that he had persuaded Israel not to start a war, and the war had come as a surprise for him.17 United States was bogged down in the Vietnam war and did not want to be drawn into any military action in the Middle East. The real question is – which “tone” the US president used to persuade his ally not to start a war. However, Israel’s swift victory suited him.18 The US actually gave a “green light” to Israeli actions. Johnson, however, supported the Soviet proposal made in June on the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution on ceasefire. It was unanimously adopted. On June 7, Israel agreed to the resolution, but on the condition of the return to the status quo ante, i.e. the opening of the Gulf of Aqaba and the withdrawal of Egyptian troops from the Sinai Peninsula. Cairo and Damascus did not immediately respond to the Soviet proposal supported by the Americans, which, according to Johnson, allowed Israel to capture the Sinai Peninsula, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. On June 8, Cairo accepted the ceasefire offer. On June 9, Damascus agreed, and Israel consented to it in the morning of June 10. But time had been lost.
Summing up the Six Day War, L. Johnson wrote,
I regretted that the Israelis has chosen to strike at the Arab forces assembled at their frontier, just as I regretted Nasser’s refusal to accept promptly our proposal for a ceasefire accompanied by reopening of Aqaba and mutual withdrawal from the Sinai. It is much easier to start a war than to make a peace. If Nasser accepted our proposal, the complex factors that led to the Israeli attack could have been quickly unravelled. The Sinai would have been cleared, and we could have moved promptly to developing a peaceful settlement in the Middle East, with some hope of early success. Arab delay

resulted in the war, ending with Israeli forces still occupying parts of Syria, Jordan, and the UAR.19
Indeed, Johnson is subjective and tends to whitewash the Americans and the Israelis. But the Arabs, who do not blame themselves but the Israelis and the Americans, see the events differently, and in their interpretation it does not fit together.
“From the founding of Israel in 1948 we had supported the territorial integrity of all the states in that region”, wrote Johnson. “Our commitment was not inscribed in any treaty, but it was strong nonetheless. It was rooted in the Tripartite Declaration of 1950, in which the United States, Great Britain and France promised to oppose any effort to alter by force the national borders in the Middle East. Four Presidents – Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and myself – had publicly reaffirmed this pledge”.20 But the problem is in the fact that in 1967 Israel did not have internationally recognized borders.
It is easy to argue with hindsight that the Soviet leaders were wrong to break off diplomatic relations with Israel. They could have recalled their ambassador and downgraded the level of relations, but left a liaison office in Israel under a neutral (e.g., Finnish) flag in order to retain a channel for permanent contacts with the Israeli government and other political forces, which would have facilitated Soviet participation in any future peace-making process. The Soviet move is usually interpreted by Western scholars as having been a gesture in favour of the Arabs. However a different explanation was given by a senior official in the Soviet foreign ministry:
OFFICIAL: Sometimes the Foreign Ministry took steps that proved harmful for our foreign policy, like the severing of diplomatic relations with Israel in 1967. It was clearly an erroneous move that cost us a pretty penny. Yet why did we undertake it? I recall a story told by Lev Mendelvich who was in the know at the time about the backroom decisions taken on the subject. At the Politbureau meeting it was Gromyko who at the last moment proposed the break so as to avoid getting involved in the large-scale military adventure that our “hawks” were insisting on. It was a sop to pacify our “hawks”.
THE AUTHOR: Who was among the “hawks” at the time? OFFICIAL: Mendelvich did not mention any names . . . Gromyko was afraid that
we would get into a clash with the United States and the missile crisis of 1962 would be repeated. The breaking off of relations with Israel was more a move in the domestic policy game than a gesture in favour of the Arabs.
On 9 June 1967 Gamal Abdel Nasser announced that he was resigning from the presidency and that a new leadership was being formed. However, millions of Egyptians came out on the streets of Cairo to demand his return to power and on 11 June he resumed office. The attempt by the military headed by Marshal Amer to organize a military coup was foiled by Nasser. Amer committed suicide.
Though it had been unable to prevent the Arab countries from being defeated in the fighting, the USSR did manage to help them escape from political and

Up the down staircase 69
strategic collapse. Soon after the end of the war it started large-scale shipments of arms and equipment supplies to Egypt and Syria and sent numerous advisers to both countries, in addition to an extraordinary amount of economic aid. The Soviet media started an anti-Israeli and anti-Zionist campaign, accusing the Israelis of “barbaric actions”,21 while Pravda used the term “genocide”.22 The Israeli defence minister Moshe Dayan was dubbed “Moshe Adolfovich” (implying that he was Hitler’s disciple), and international Zionism was variously portrayed as a band of gangsters, a tool of the Wall Street bankers and sometimes the controller of Wall Street. Zionism was treated not as a political trend but as a criminal conspiracy directed against all peace-loving peoples. Inspired by Judaist teaching it had allegedly always been a brand of racism: its purpose was world domination. However, claimed the Soviet media, “Israeli aggression” had failed to achieve its main goal because the “progressive” Arab regimes had not been overthrown.23
The USSR’s Middle East policy was the main topic discussed at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the CPSU on 21 June 1967, and the resolution stated that “Israeli aggression” was
the result of a conspiracy among the most reactionary forces of world imperialism, first and foremost of the USA, directed against a detachment of the national liberation movement, against the vanguard Arab states which have taken the path of progressive socio-economic transformation in the interests of the toiling masses and which are pursuing an anti-imperialist policy.24
It further noted that the task of Soviet foreign policy towards the Middle East would be
to continue . . . resolutely to rebuff imperialist intrigues, to unmask the true unpopular character of imperialism, and combat the slander campaign and divisive actions of the Mao Tse Tung group whose purpose is to sow discord among the anti-imperialist forces and to undermine the trust between the peoples of the Arab states and those of the socialist countries.25
Thereafter these theories and arguments were ceaselessly reiterated by Soviet scholars and journalists.
In 1990 I spoke about this to E. D. Pyrlin,26 former deputy chief of the Middle Eastern department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, and later a researcher on the Middle East:
THE AUTHOR: Now, after so many years, do you still consider that the US was interested in the 1967 war?
E. D. PYRLIN: Very probably yes. There was a great deal of truth in what we wrote then. They certainly wanted to embarrass or to topple Nasser and the Syrian Baathists – either one at a time or simultaneously.
THE AUTHOR: However, both the Israeli political leaders and Israeli scholars write that their troops were not concentrated on the Syrian border.

70 Up the down staircase
E. D. PYRLIN: Israel could mobilise its army within a day. All that was needed to start a war was a political decision, and this already seemed to have been taken. Then Nasser gave them an excuse by having the United Nations forces removed and blocking the Straits of Tiran. We could have interfered and told Nasser in no uncertain terms to cancel his decision. But we didn’t dare, because we were afraid of antagonizing him.27
Arab public opinion and many political leaders accused the Soviet Union of having failed to prevent the defeat of its Arab friends.
In the Arab national character in general the feeling of remorse and selfcriticism, which, in contrast, is characteristic of the Russian national character, is very uncommon. The failures and defeats are blamed on fate (qadar), the imperialists, the Soviet Union – anyone but the Arabs themselves. However, at this time the extent of the military defeat and humiliation of Arab nationalism was such that the cleansing wave of self-criticism swept a few months later, but it involved only a thin layer of the left intelligentsia.
The Soviet press ascribed Israel’s military successes to a sudden attack, to Western arms supplies, to its cooperation with the United States, to the chauvinistic mood of the Israeli population and so on, while Nasser was said to have been betrayed by the “military bourgeoisie”, especially by the air forces command. It was pointed out that extremist anti-Israeli slogans had inflicted tremendous harm on the Arab cause, and claims were made that the progressive regimes in Egypt and Syria had been defeated because they were not progressive enough. To become stronger and to regain their lost territories the regimes needed to purge all political and military structures of reactionaries and anti-Soviet elements.
The Soviet Union continued actively to play its diplomatic cards in the Middle Eastern game while rendering military and economic aid to its allies, Egypt and Syria. On 19 June 1967, in response to the 5th emergency session of the UN General Assembly held two days previously the Soviet prime minister, A. N. Kosygin put forward a draft resolution stating in particular that the General Assembly should: (1) resolutely denounce Israel’s aggressive acts and its continuing occupation of certain parts of Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian territory, which was an act of aggression under international law; and (2) urge Israel to withdraw all its troops from these territories to positions behind the demarcation line as stipulated by the general ceasefire agreements . . .28 One notes again that there was no mention in the draft of the Palestinians, who were to be at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict some years later. The US and its allies prevented the Soviet draft from being adopted by the General Assembly but failed to pass their own resolution.
During June and July 1967 the presidents of Algeria (Boumedienne), Iraq (Aref) and Syria (Atasi) were received in Moscow. N. V. Podgorny, chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, visited Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad during July and August. In October 1967 King Hussein of Jordan went to Moscow, followed by Nasser in July 1968.
The principles of a political settlement of the Middle East crisis were discussed at meetings of the Security Council between 9–22 November 1967, and on 22 November Resolution 242, moved by Britain in the nature of a compromise,

Up the down staircase 71
was adopted unanimously. It provided in particular for “withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from the territories occupied during the recent conflict”. After the voting the Soviet delegate said that he had voted for the British draft, interpreting it as providing for a withdrawal of Israeli forces “from all the Arab territories seized by them as a result of the aggression of 5 June 1967”. The Resolution recognised Israel’s right to exist and dealt with the Palestinian question only as a difficulty involving refugees.
When interviewed by the present writer, the former USSR ambassador to Syria, Y. N. Chernyakov29 mentioned a hitherto unfamiliar aspect of this diplomatic struggle:
Y. N. CHERNYAKOV: The Americans did not and do not reckon with the Arabs since Israel is their master.
THE AUTHOR: Do you think that Israel determines US policy? Y. N. CHERNYAKOV: At least towards the Arab countries. THE AUTHOR: I’m for a balanced approach to this matter. Y. N CHERNYAKOV: I can give you an example. During the 1967 war I maintained
contacts with Washington. The Americans took care of Israel more than of themselves. The Soviet ambassador to the United States, Dobrynin, came to New York with the Soviet delegation led by Gromyko, and stayed behind when Gromyko left. The main US figure during the discussions on the resolutions was Mr Goldberg, the US ambassador to the United Nations. When the positions of the various parties diverge a text is often contrived that can be interpreted in different ways. On this occasion too such an equivocal text was prepared, and Goldberg probably failed to understand the essence of the matter and he agreed with a formulation that suited us and the Arabs. When the Israelis saw it, I think that Goldberg must have caught it in the neck since he retracted his proposal. However he had given Dobrynin his initial draft, which wasn’t typed or signed but which was written in his own handwriting, and Dobrynin didn’t return the paper to him. When Goldberg started shouting that he had made no such proposal, Dobrynin asked: “Well, who wrote this?” Goldberg got confused, but nevertheless he completely disowned his proposal. Later on the British version was adopted.30
At the end of 1968 the Soviet government proposed a plan for implementing Resolution 242. Israel and the neighbouring Arab states would simultaneously announce their readiness to terminate the state of war between them and to reach a peaceful settlement following Israeli troop withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, and in this connection Israel would announce its readiness to begin the withdrawal of its troops on a fixed date. Additionally, on the date so fixed and under UN supervision, the Arab countries and Israel would both deposit appropriate documents at UN headquarters concerning the termination of the state of war, and respect for and recognition of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of all states of the region, and their right to live within secure and recognized frontiers as provided for in Resolution 242. Issues concerning secure and recognized frontiers, guarantees for freedom of navigation in

72 Up the down staircase
international waters in the region, a just settlement of the refugee problem, and guarantees of the territorial inviolability and political independence of each state in the Middle East, could all be agreed upon in accordance with an arrangement that might be achieved under the auspices of the UN.31 The USSR reiterated the main provisions of this plan a year later, in January 1970.32
Meanwhile the crisis-like situation in the region prompted the leaders of the USSR, the USA, Britain and France jointly to search for a solution. The heads of their diplomatic agencies consulted on finding ways to implement the Security Council’s resolutions,33 and following a meeting of the four foreign ministers with the UN Secretary General, a communiqué was issued on 22 November 1969 noting in particular that the participants in the four-part consultations reaffirmed the need to support and implement the Security Council resolution of 22 November 1967, agreed that a lasting peace should be established in the Middle East and recognized the inalienable right of all Middle Eastern states to exist as independent and sovereign. The Soviet Union seemed to have become a fully-fledged partner in the political processes in the Middle East, but no other meetings of this kind were ever convened again.
Soon a new element began to appear in Soviet proposals for a Middle East settlement – the demand “to exercise the legitimate rights of the Arab people of Palestine”: this was mentioned in the resolutions of the 24th Congress of the CPSU in March 1971.34
Even though the defeat of its allies dented Soviet prestige, Soviet influence in the region, built up over the previous decade, did not collapse as a result of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. On the contrary; the socio-political processes that had gained strength in the 1950s and early 1960s continued under their own momentum and were even accelerated by the war, while Arab public opinion considered the war to have been the “aggression of Israel in collusion with the United States”, which was in keeping with the Soviet version of events. The strengthening wave of anti-Western (“anti-imperialist”) feelings was conducive to a new Baathist coup in Iraq in July 1968, to a left-radical coup in the Sudan in May 1969, and to a revolution in Libya on 1 September 1969. The attractiveness of many elements of the socio-political model reproduced from that of the Soviet Union had not yet completely faded. Did not the military and political successes of Vietnam and Cuba showed the mobilization potential of radical left regimes? And was not Egypt, leader of the Arab world, moving further and further along that path?
The essence of the matter, though, was rather different. The Soviet leaders had demonstrated that they would not allow friendly regimes to collapse and that they possessed the means and the capabilities to prevent such an occurrence. Egypt and Syria were given military aid on a scale that was supposed to restore and increase their military potential. Construction of big projects – some of epoch-making importance such as the Aswan and Euphrates Dams, the Helwan steel plant, etc. – continued with Soviet cooperation. Increasing numbers of Egyptians, Syrians and Iraqis were being educated in the USSR. However, other trends were becoming prominent at the same time and would, from as early as the first half of the 1970s, start to erode Soviet influence in the Middle East.

Up the down staircase 73
It was not that the revolutionary authoritarian regimes were unable to solve their domestic problems, as was partly true – because after all failures could be attributed to “imperialist and Zionist intrigues” and to the state of war. Their internal crises would appear later.
The crux of the problem was the inherent contradiction within the Soviet attitude to the Arab-Israeli conflict. While arming Egypt and Syria, the Soviet Union neither desired nor planned a military solution to the problem, a decisive preponderance of Arabs, or a change in the status quo. First, the leaders were afraid of a new Arab defeat. Second, in the event of such a defeat the USSR would have had to raise the level of its involvement in the conflict in order to save its friends and its investments. Third, actions of this kind might provoke a US reaction and lead to a confrontation. Fourth, a settlement would decrease the dependence of the Arab countries on Soviet support. In fact the USSR was interested in maintaining a “neither peace nor war” situation, though formally Soviet diplomacy spared no efforts to settle the conflict. When interviewed by the present writer, the former Soviet ambassador to Egypt, V. M. Vinogradov, rejected the idea of such interest outright.35 He might have referred to Brezhnev’s official statement: “The Soviet Union was, is, and will be vitally interested in an early, lasting and just peaceful settlement in the Middle East”.36
The Arab leaders, who had adopted the three “no’s” at the Khartoum summit (30 August–1 September 1967) – i.e. no recognition of Israel, no peace and no direct negotiations with Israel – were not ready for a political settlement or for compromises. Yet the delay in settling the conflict was destroying the power base of both the Egyptian and the Syrian regimes and pushing their leaders into military actions that were generally undesirable for the Soviet leaders. Nasser gradually regained control over the country and got rid of his rivals from among the military, including his former friend Marshal Abd al-Hakim Amer, Egypt’s other Hero of the Soviet Union. He was steering cautiously between the leftists who enjoyed Soviet sympathies and the rightists who were inclined to resume cooperation with the West and to give up the socialist experiment. However, his freedom to manoeuvre was constrained by the stigma of the national humiliation of the 1967 defeat and by the continuing Israeli occupation of Sinai. The difficult confrontation with Israel and the West compelled Nasser to continue his rapprochement with the USSR. For the Soviet Union, of course, their cooperation with Egypt remained top priority in the region and thanks to Soviet arms supplies and to its military advisers the Egyptian army was being speedily restored to effectiveness. High-level delegations continued to be exchanged between the two countries, and Nasser’s cooperation with leftists and Marxists created the illusion in Moscow that Egypt was still moving in the “right” direction. I discussed this in 1990 with B. N. Ponomarev:
B. N. PONOMAREV: Nasser was a progressive leader, a friend of the USSR. He wanted Egypt to move along the path of social progress.
THE AUTHOR: In your understanding, social progress is the gradual rapprochement with the Soviet model, isn’t it?

74 Up the down staircase
B. N. PONOMAREV: Of course that’s what I mean. I remember Nasser was once receiving treatment at Barvikha (a sanatorium in the Moscow suburbs for top-ranking Soviet leaders and foreign guests – A.V.), and I visited him there for a talk. We got into conversation, and he was very frank with me. He said he wanted to develop socialism and social progress, to get closer to socialism. It was evident that he was developing in a direction favourable for us in the sense of rapprochement with the USSR, as well as of the anti-imperialist struggle, the struggle for socialism. I informed our top authorities about it.37
Soviet weaponry was also flowing into Syria to compensate for losses in the war, and A. A. Grechko, the Soviet defence minister, visited Damascus in March 1968. One of the causes of the Syrian defeat had been the withdrawal of several combatready units from the front to strengthen the Baathist rulers and internal security, since the Syrian Leadership was more afraid of domestic enemies than of Israel. This policy proved effective and the opposition became weak and badly coordinated. Soviet-Syrian military cooperation was paralleled by “ideological” cooperation and a Baathist team went to Moscow for “ideological discussions”. The flexible Syrians had no difficulty in ringing slogans that sounded harmonious to Moscow and thus improved their chances of receiving Soviet aid. Syria needed protection and had something to offer in exchange, both strategically and economically. However, for the USSR Syria remained an uneasy ally whose actions were beyond control, often unpredictable and the cause of complications. The ultraleftist slogans originating from Damascus (such as a “people’s war” against Israel) were not received enthusiastically in Moscow. Mustafa Tlas, the new Syrian chief of staff, was a theoretician of guerrilla warfare and had even translated works by Che Guevara who was not particularly popular among the Soviet leaders.
As a means of enhancing their domestic prestige and exerting pressure on Israel, the Egyptian and Syrian leaders needed to take certain anti-Israeli actions and decided to begin on less intensive hostile measures, prompted also in this by the selective military actions still being taken by Israel against Egypt, Syria and Jordan. In March 1969 Egypt began a “war of attrition” which included exchanges of gunfire, air fights and commando raids across the Suez Canal in which the Israelis, who had entrenched themselves behind the Bar Lev line on the east bank of the canal, suffered some losses. The following month Cairo announced formally that it no longer considered itself bound by the ceasefire commitments. After some hesitation the USSR decided not to object to these operations. Soviet military officers who were training their Egyptian colleagues also suffered some casualties, and for a time a sort of “fraternity-in-arms” grew up between the Soviet and Egyptian servicemen stationed along the Suez Canal. The Egyptian leaders were generous with statements pleasing to the ears of Moscow.38 Nasser commented in April 1970 that “Thanks to Soviet aid we have managed to restore the UAR’s defence capacity and we are now in a position to reply to Israel’s attacks with broad-scale operations”.39
However, shortly after this Israel, relying on the higher combat levels of its army, its superior military organisation and air supremacy, decided to shift the

Up the down staircase 75
“war of attrition” deeper into Egyptian territory by attacking military, economic and civilian targets. The Israeli air force’s raids into Egypt reached a peak during December 1969, aggravating the domestic political situation to such an extent and damaging Nasser’s prestige to such a degree that he took the unprecedented step of asking the USSR, during a secret visit to Moscow on 22 January 1970, to send him some of its regular air-defence forces and military aircraft. To comply with Nasser’s request meant exceeding all the USSR’s previous obligations to such an extent that the decision had to be taken by all members of the Politbureau of the Central Committee of the CPSU as well as by the Commander of the Soviet armed forces.40 Yet once again it was not only the attempt to save Nasser’s regime but also the military and strategic interests of the Soviet Union itself, that determined the decision of the Soviet leadership.
The Middle East in Soviet military strategy
Immediately after World War II the strategic threat to the USSR from the south came from the presence of American and British military bases in the region. However, from the late 1950s the aircraft carriers of the US Sixth Fleet began to acquire equipment that would enable jet aircraft to reach into the southern regions of the USSR and the territories of its Balkan allies. A response to this new American challenge was demanded.
As early as the 1930s the Soviet military command had clearly understood the global strategic assignment required for the Soviet navy, but the geographical position of the USSR, its weak industrial base and its military and technological capabilities on the eve of World War II, had restricted the navy’s strength and destined it to be used as no more than an auxiliary force for supporting ground operations. Nevertheless, a programme had already been put in place for building dozens of battleships and heavy cruisers over a period of 15–20 years and although sidelined by the war, the plans were not cancelled. The author has no documents or data concerning the terms of and the figures for the navy development programme, but on the basis of conversations with Naval Staff officers and information from Western sources the following picture emerges.
In the early 1950s a series of large ships were already on the stocks, and by the time of Stalin’s death in 1953, six of the planned 24 Sverdlov-class cruisers were operational and 14 were under construction.41 These would, of course, have been designed several years earlier, probably on the eve of World War II, but at the same time design of ocean-going submarines with atomic-powered engines was under way. This suggests that the claim that the USSR’s large-scale naval programme had begun in the mid-1950s may not be accurate and this date is probably used because that was when S. G. Gorshkov became Commmander-inChief of the navy. I am not in a position to discuss the merits or demerits of this Soviet military leader, but certainly when Nikita Khrushchev, euphoric with the success of the Soviet rocket-building industry, daringly gave the order to chop the nearly-built cruisers on the slips into pieces because they were “unnecessary”, Gorshkov did not resign. This was a sound tactic since it enabled him to convince

76 Up the down staircase
Khrushchev and the political leadership of the need to build a fleet of ocean-going submarines (nuclear and conventional) and modern fighting ships including those for use in anti-submarine warfare.42
The Americans put a nuclear-powered submarine into service in 1955, as well as the aircraft carrier Forrestal which could carry jet aircraft. The appearance of Soviet diesel-powered ocean-going submarines in the 1950s and atomic-powered submarines in the late 1950s and early 1960s indicates that their construction programme must have been carried out from the late 1940s and early 1950s. The failure in Cuba in 1962 also appears to have been an additional inducement to improving and developing a long-range navy. Meanwhile the abilities of Soviet naval aviation were also being extended.
By the early 1960s the Soviet Black Sea fleet, constricted by the Black Sea bottleneck, was carrying out defensive functions only. British air force bases in Egypt, Iraq and Palestine had been abandoned, but US navy and air force strength in the region had, on the contrary, been augmented, and the threat to the Soviet Union increased sharply after 1963 when the Americans started deploying submarines carrying Polaris missiles (with an approximate 2500 km range) in the Mediterranean. These missiles considerably reinforced the first-strike capacity already existing in the nuclear bomb-carrying aircraft aboard the ships of the Sixth fleet.
The decision was taken in Moscow to send Soviet naval ships to the Mediterranean, in view of the rapidly expanding navy. It will be remembered that Russian Navy ships had appeared in the Mediterranean during the 18th century. In 1770 the Russian navy was victorious at the battle of Chesma. During the 1770s a squadron commanded by G. Spiridov supported the attempts of Ali Bey to found an Egyptian state independent of the Porte. Russian ships operated in the Mediterranean during the Napoleonic Wars, and Emperor Paul of Russia even acquired the title of Grand Master of the Order of Malta, though these events did not produce politico-military results. The Russians took part in the victorious sea battles against the Turks at Afon (1807) and Navarine (1827) as part of a joint squadron with the British and the French. Following defeat during the Crimean War of 1854–1855 restrictions were imposed on the size of the Black Sea fleet, but by the late 19th–early 20th century Russian naval ships were to be seen in the Eastern Mediterranean, in the Red Sea, the Gulf and the Indian Ocean, only to disappear over the horizon after the October Revolution in 1917.
In 1963 S.G. Gorshkov, still Commander-in-Chief, wrote “So far our naval ships and naval aviation have played an auxiliary role in support of the ground forces. Now . . . we should be prepared for large-scale offensive operations in order to strike smashing blows at the sea and land targets of the imperialists at any point around the world’s oceans and shores”.43 Four years later he noted that “the great imperialist powers have already lost the domination of the seas” and that sooner or later “they would understand that they have no supremacy at all”, adding that “the flag of the Soviet Navy now flies proudly over seas and oceans”.44 In 1963–1964 Soviet naval ships began to appear regularly in the Mediterranean and were formed into the Mediterranean squadron in 1968. They had no aircraft carriers or Air Force support to protect them and were (and have remained) weaker

Up the down staircase 77
than the American Sixth Fleet although, according to American data, they had a well-developed anti-aircraft defence system and the means to engage in antisubmarine warfare, including helicopters. In the event of nuclear war they were evidently assigned the role of an expendable advanced task force – i.e. they were to strike and to be lost, but the gain from that sacrifice would be the neutralizing or weakening of the American nuclear attack from the Mediterranean. But cold war logic held that the doomed squadron would not be touched since an attack on them, as on the ground forces in Western Europe, would mean the beginning of a global conflict.
Soviet naval ships were to operate in the Mediterranean without land bases, accompanied by a “suite” – a train of vessels carrying and supplying fuel and water, repairs and ammunition. This was expensive and certainly diminished the squadron’s fighting efficiency, as the crews, particularly in the submarines, became tired and exhausted. Logic demanded land bases to lessen vulnerability and expense. The rupture with Albania had lost the USSR the comfortable submarine base that it had occupied at Flera between 1958 and 1961, and there had been cautious explorations with Cairo over the possibility of using Egyptian naval bases.45
But to obtain bases on another country’s territory, whether as a privilege, or as a place for relaxation, or for undertaking repairs, would drastically contradict the Soviet foreign policy principles that had so efficiently won friends and recruited allies in the region: i.e. the elimination of the foreign military presence in the Middle East. The Arabs had banished British and American bases and were not allowing them to establish new ones, although it was being “explained” to them that bases were needed so the Arabs could be defended “from Communist aggression” and “the intentions of the Soviet expansionists”. Now the question began to arise of the need for Soviet military bases to defend them “from Zionist expansion” and against “the conspiracies of the imperialists”.
The defeat of Egypt and Syria in 1967 forced these countries to accede to the wishes of the USSR. As Nasser commented in 1968: “After the June war only the Russians helped us with urgently needed aid from wheat to fighters, while the Americans helped our enemy. Nor did they demand any reimbursement for their help except some privileges for their navy in Port Said and Alexandria”.46 Depots for fuel and spare parts were built in Alexandria and Port Said, and entry formalities into Egyptian ports were made easier for Soviet naval ships. These arrangements were made on the basis of mutual interests. Egypt was certainly keen to have the presence of the Soviet naval ships as a protection against anticipated Israeli attacks. On 10 July 1967 eight Soviet craft anchored in Port Said – missile cruisers, destroyers and landing craft – and six went to Alexandria.47 Soviet ships also began to visit the Syrian port of Latakia.
The decision to build an air-defence system in Egypt appears to have been a political decision made with the aim of saving Nasser’s regime, though the needs of the Soviet navy would doubtless also have been taken into account. Soviet combat personnel began to arrive in the Egyptian Delta during February 1970. Eighteen batteries of SAM-3s, 80 MiG-21 and MiG-23 and several MiG-25

fighter aircraft were deployed, and there were around 20,000 Soviet military personnel, including advisers in the Egyptian armed forces, in the country. Some airfields and missile installations were fully under Soviet control.48 By mid-1970 the Soviet navy was based in the harbours of Alexandria, Port Said and Salloum, and later at Mersa Matruh and Bernis.49 The presence of the Soviet air-defence and air force units in Egypt was perhaps a kind of reinforcement for the Soviet naval squadron in the Mediterranean, which lacked aircraft carriers. This sort of information may well become clearer when the relevant Soviet documents are made publicly available, although informal conversation supports our suppositions:
THE AUTHOR: Did the Soviet leadership have the impression that all of them – the Mediterranean squadron, the airfields and naval bases in Egypt – were destined for a global conflict with the USA?
A GRU OFFICER: The bases in Egypt were aimed at reinforcing the squadron and extending its viability. But as for the Middle East and North Africa, the role of the naval squadron was mostly political: to show the flag, to demonstrate to the allies that we were close to them, and to constrain US actions politically. Nobody thought seriously about a large-scale war.
THE AUTHOR: Don’t you think our policy in the Arab world was coloured by military-strategic considerations?
A GRU OFFICER: No, it was mostly coloured by political and strategic considerations. Purely military considerations weren’t the prime concern. The Foreign Ministry was of the same opinion, and seems to have agreed with the military leadership on this matter.
From 1968 there was a constant Soviet military presence in the Indian Ocean, and ships of the Soviet Pacific Fleet began to appear throughout the Pacific region. These developments coincided with the British withdrawal from the areas “East of Suez” and with the heightening of tension between the Soviets and the Chinese. The Soviet flag was seen in Mogadishu, Madras, Bombay and the Gulf. A new threat appeared when American submarines carrying first Polaris ballistic missiles, and later Poseidon (range: 5,300 km) and in the 1980s Trident I (range: 7,400 km) and already in the post-Soviet era Trident II (range: 11,300 km) ballistic missiles appeared in the Indian Ocean. However, some American authors argue that these submarines were on combat duty in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
The global arms race seemed set to roll on. The need to establish naval bases in the Indian Ocean set military logic above the prized political principle (“Down with foreign bases on our territories”), and the USSR obtained bases (“privileges”) at Berbera and Aden. The great powers then “swapped” allies, with the USSR “castling” Somalia for Ethiopia so that it thereby obtained a base in Ethiopia while the USA took Berbera. It was during those years that American political scientists invented the widely used term “a zero-sum game” to describe these sorts of situation.
The Americans – the leading naval power of the 20th century – reacted as expected to Soviet naval development. In addition, it was combined with the

Up the down staircase 79
worsening of the international situation generally as well as with the arguments over the deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe and the operations of Soviet troops in Afghanistan. One American observer noted that American “russophobia” saw the Soviet navy as a direct threat to the United States itself, remarking that the antagonism between the two powers resembled that between Britain and Germany on the eve of the First World War.50 Meanwhile the importance of the Soviet presence in the Eastern Mediterranean was heightened by the expanding traffic on the sea route from the Black Sea through the Straits of Bab el-Mandeb to the Far East, whose importance to the Soviet economy was growing steadily.
But let us return to the Mediterranean. As early as April 1967 Brezhnev suggested that the Sixth Fleet should be withdrawn, a proposal which Washington ignored then (and later) since US naval superiority in the Mediterranean region was too great to be relinquished.51 In 1968 Andrei Gromyko stated that
The Soviet Union, being a Black Sea power and, therefore, a Mediterranean power as well, is interested in peace and security in the regions adjoining its southern borders . . . . The presence of Soviet naval ships in the Mediterranean makes it easier to maintain security in the entire Mediterranean zone.52
Egypt and Syria shared this point of view, and declared on several occasions that they regarded the Soviet navy as their shield against the aggressive intentions of the American Sixth Fleet. France, Italy and Spain had reservations about the emergence of the Soviet Mediterranean squadron, while the West’s allies in the Eastern Mediterranean – Greece, Turkey and Israel – expressed their considerable apprehension and misgivings. The Turkish foreign ministry published figures in 1968 showing that a record number of Soviet ships had passed along the Black Sea straits in 1967, including 107 ships following the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli war.53 Israel had its own reason for being concerned, particularly after the Egyptians, using a Soviet-made missile, had sunk the Israeli destroyer Eilat. But the USSR was not sufficiently strong during this period to have undertaken any major intervention in the Middle East.
When the US doctrine of “massive retaliation” got under way during the early 1960s and the danger of mutual destruction was becoming increasingly real, both Moscow and Washington began to take preventive measures in order to avoid a nuclear war. The USA invented the “limited nuclear war” principle which implied that nuclear weapons might not be used directly against the Soviet Union but could be deployed in any theatre of military operations where the interests of the USA and of the West generally were threatened. The “hotline” was set up between the Kremlin and the White House. In 1963 the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was concluded, followed by the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968 and the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I) in 1972. The two powers were attempting to reduce the risk of a nuclear catastrophe through this network of treaties and agreements, but it was a difficult and uneven process and neither side quite knew how it might co-exist with the other in a new world order. There

was a certain element of trial and error. But the growing understanding between Washington and Moscow did not extend to the Middle East, which continued to be a “cold war” battlefield.
The Soviet military presence in Egypt did not, as noted, avoid losses. Several planes piloted by Soviet crew were shot down by the Israelis, the Soviet military authorities having initially underestimated the capabilities of the electronic equipment used by the Israeli air force. However, the strengthening of Egyptian air defences and the consequent loss of Israeli planes forced the Israelis to curtail the air raids, resulting in a stalemate, which, however, pushed the protagonists into accepting America’s “Rogers Plan” in November 1969, and to agree to a ceasefire on 7 August 1970. The Egyptians then moved their anti-aircraft missile-launching complexes to the west bank of the Suez Canal, having rebuilt their entire airdefence system. The Israelis regarded this as a breach of the ceasefire agreement but took no action since it was not in their interests to renew hostilities at the time.
By the late 1960s the Palestinians were becoming increasingly vocal around the Middle East over their claims, which were not solely confined to the refugee problem and the question of defending their rights. The Palestinian movement was itself becoming a politico-military factor in the region. Israel’s occupation of the whole of Palestine and the establishing of settlements in the Arab parts of the territory had deprived the Palestinians of their rights and their human dignity and even of the illusion of the existence of a homeland, and a strong sense of unity had grown, among those still inside Israel and among those who had gone into exile. Various Palestinian political and military organizations had been formed and these were united into the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964. It was of course the following generation of young people, raised under Israeli occupation, who would create trouble for Israel though the intifada – the unarmed uprising that began in the late 1980s. But for the time being it was not Israel that was destabilized by the Palestinian military-political organizations but Jordan, the country that had been most affected by the war. The turn of Lebanon was still to come.
In Jordan, Palestinian units strengthened their positions within the refugee camps and challenged the ruler whose power had been undermined by the 1967 defeat. The hi-jacking of international airliners by members of left-wing extremist Palestinian organizations based in Jordan drew huge publicity, and a dualpower regime was being shaped within the country. Faced with the question of his political survival, King Husain, assisted by loyal troops, began military operations against the armed Palestinian groups. During August and September 1970 there was serious fighting in Amman and in other parts of Jordan resulting in thousands of casualties, and clashes continued until July 1971, when the Jordanian army managed to regain full control of the country. The situation in Jordan caused serious difficulties in international relations and threatened to cause a new outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East. The Palestinians had the full backing of Syria and were also supported by Iraq. Syrian armoured units had moved into northern Jordan during the fighting, though according to one version of events they had clashed unsuccessfully with Jordanian troops and had retreated. Another

Up the down staircase 81
account (told to the author by Soviet military specialists) claims that there were two Syrian armoured columns which lost their way at night, collided with each other, engaged in combat and, having inflicted considerable damage to each other, retired whence they had come. The Soviet advisers, accustomed to varnishing their reports, apparently did not send this information back to Moscow because bureaucratic questions would have been asked: “What are you teaching the Syrians? You are doing ‘bad work!’”
But the unsettled situation in the Middle East was not due to military failure in the north of Jordan but to the tremendous military and political pressures being exerted on Syria by Israel and by the United States. The US had concentrated the Sixth Fleet into the Eastern Mediterranean at the height of the crisis, and President Nixon threatened that either the US or Israel would intervene militarily in Jordan should Syria and Iraq come to the assistance of the Palestinian guerrillas.54
The Soviet Union was not ready to intervene in the conflict. The Soviet leadership was repelled by the extremism of the Palestinians, which is why the TASS statements on 20 September 1970,55 the Foreign Affairs ministry statement on 24 September56 and Brezhnev’s speech in Baku on 2 October,57 contained only the customary attacks against “conspiracies of imperialist and reactionary forces” and reiterations of support for “the just struggle of the Arab peoples”, and did not even hint at positive action, although the Soviet mass media did express sympathy with the Palestinians. In addition the attention of the Soviet leadership was fixed on an even more important event – the departure of President Nasser from the world stage.
Nasser died on 28 September 1970, and his death signalled the end of a whole epoch in Soviet-Arab relations. When Nasser took the courageous step in the 1950s of challenging the West by electing to buy Soviet weapons, he could not have anticipated how closely his own political survival and the fate of Egypt itself would have become tied to Moscow. His reputation among the Soviet leadership was high and their respect for him helped maintain Egyptian-Soviet relations through some anxious times. Gromyko noted in his memoirs that “had this man had lived for a couple more years, the situation in the (Middle East) region might have turned out in quite another way”.58 And E. D. Pyrlin, in an interview with the author, made the following comments:
E. D. PYRLIN: Among all those with whom I had contacts, Nasser left the deepest impression on me, and I’m not unusual in my appraisal. Nasser was a personality. This personality was head and shoulders above other leaders in the Arab East, both past and present. Conversations with Nasser stuck in one’s memory because of his tenacity; in other words he could answer a difficult question on the spot and grasp a problem in its totality. What was Sadat’s weak point in this respect? He would snatch at a particular detail and stick to it, to the detriment of the essence of the matter. Nasser would perceive the whole problem. I must have taken part in eight or nine meetings with him and each one left an enormous impression, all the more so because these conversations lasted for five or six hours. By the end of his life he was already a

82 Up the down staircase
sick man. He was ill with vascular complications . . . . He could not endure sitting in one position for more than three minutes at a time, but in spite of this, he would put up with those tiresome conversations and those deadly dull negotiations. And each time he’d find some new argument or other in defence of his position.59
Soviet support had rescued Nasser three times – in 1956, 1967 and 1970 – and Soviet-Egyptian cooperation was on an unprecedented scale for the Third World, both militarily and economically. But this cooperation also caused damage to Egypt by temporarily breaking some of its long-established links with the West and by partially transferring to Egypt certain elements of the Soviet socio-political system which had been unsuccessful in the USSR itself. Nasser knew both victory and defeat but he remains one of the giants of the Third World, alongside Nehru, Sukarno and Nkrumah, who personified the whole era of liberation from the political domination of the West and of cooperation with the Soviet Union.
Soviet influence had grown rapidly in the Middle East during the Nasserist era. In the late 1960s Walter Laqueur commented that:
The Soviet position in the Middle East is stronger today than it was ten years ago. This was not the result of invasion, nor of infiltration by stealth: the Soviet Union became a Middle East power by invitation. It has seized no military bases, but was offered the facilities it wanted by the governments of Egypt and Syria, Algeria and the Yemen, of their own free will . . . not one country has been taken over, no attempt has been made to impose from above the communist political and social system. There have been changes in some countries, but they were the outcome of internal ferment, not outside pressure. Soviet influence has grown not because of the spread of communist ideology, but as the result of efforts made on different levels to make friends and influence people: loans, arms supplies, political assistance, support of the Arab countries against the West and Israel . . . neither bases nor oil nor political conformity are expected in return. The Soviet Union has been willing to cooperate with kings and sheikhs as well as ultra-radical revolutionaries. The fact that some of these leaders were militantly anti-communist was no obstacle . . . Israel was the only exception, but in this instance, too, the reasons for Soviet hostility were not primarily ideological. Having to choose between the Arab states and Israel, Moscow opted for the bigger battalions, which it thought were also the stronger battalions.
Soviet objectives in the Middle East are easily defined: to remove Western influence in the region and to strengthen the Soviet position there as much as possible. Turkey and Iran have been to some extent neutralized.60
The Israeli scholar Shimon Shamir also noted in the early 1970s that as a result of a decade and a half of contradictory but constant penetration the Soviet Union had become a Mediterranean power with recognized interests in the Middle East where it was regulating economic investments, exerting political influence and using military bases.61

One could cite dozens of statements of this kind made by political leaders and political scientists both in the West and in Israel, and it is easy now, after many decades have elapsed, to refute or to criticize them. But at that time the situation was widely perceived in this way in the West (with some exceptions), in the Arab countries and in the USSR as well. But were there any sceptics in the Soviet Union who might have had doubts as to the fundamental principles and the criteria for success? There were some – not the people involved with foreign policy or among the leadership, but the handful of dissidents, some of the experts, a few intellectuals – who may have doubted the ultimate success of the Middle East enterprise but whose opinions were not available for public consumption and who may in any case have been silenced by the successes in Vietnam, by the appearance of tanks in Prague and by the coup in Chile that showed the uglier side of the West when its political interests were infringed upon.
Five million Egyptians came to follow the coffin with Nasser. The uncontrollable weeping crowd pushed A.N. Kosygin, who had arrived for the funeral, aside from the motorcade with the body of the late President.
The Soviet leadership did not particularly trust the new Egyptian president, Muhammad Anwar Sadat, but they did not interfere in the power struggle that took place following Nasser’s death. In May 1971, having succeeded in outplaying his adversaries – the pro-Soviet Ali Sabri group – and putting them behind bars, Sadat consolidated his position, although in the absence of any success in the liberating of Sinai from Israel, his situation was still a little shaky. He therefore set about a dual game. On the one hand, he pretended to continue to strengthen relations with the USSR, by signing the Agreement of Friendship and Cooperation with Moscow on 15 May 1971. By this means he hoped to saturate his armed forces with Soviet armaments in anticipation of another war with Israel. The Soviet Union also needed the appearance of maintaining relations and even formalizing them, for reasons of self-assertion and for bargaining with the USA.
On the other hand Sadat began to establish contacts with the United States, the country with which he was truly in sympathy, in the vain hope that Washington would lean on Israel to force it to make concessions. An exchange of messages began between Sadat and Nixon but the presence of Soviet troops on Egyptian soil was a serious obstacle to rapprochement with the Americans. Washington did not put much trust in the Egyptian president either.
Sadat visited Moscow in March 1971, hoping to convince the Soviet leadership to give him more weapons and to offer suitable protestations of friendship62 and “mutual struggle against imperialism”. He had no difficulty in paying compliments to the Soviet Union, proclaiming on 10 June 1971 that “our friendship with the USSR is not temporary . . . but permanent. We have acted and will always act within the world’s united anti-imperialist revolutionary front”.63 He also stated that “the Soviet Union, without any hesitation and without any conditions places all its experience at the disposal of the young, independent states that are struggling for economic development and to defend their independence. It’s the reality we live, not the words that we hear”.64
But deliveries of military equipment from the USSR were being delayed, and a mutual irritation and lack of understanding was growing between Cairo and

84 Up the down staircase
Moscow. In October 1971 Sadat went again to Moscow to smooth things over, also visiting in February 1972 and again on 27 April on the eve of the meeting between Nixon and Brezhnev, since he was becoming convinced that the ArabIsraeli conflict had lost its primary importance in Soviet foreign policy. He was also highly suspicious of the meeting between Brezhnev and Nixon, fearing that they might agree on something that would be to his detriment. The Soviet Union was not, of course, going to sacrifice the move towards detente in order to meet Sadat’s demands. The message sent to Sadat on 6 July by Brezhnev contained hazy details about the negotiations with Nixon and verbal reassurances of Soviet support for the Arab cause.65
Sadat decided to act. On 7 July he informed the Soviet ambassador in Cairo that 15,000 Soviet specialists should leave Egypt by 17 July,66 and demanded that all Soviet armaments operated by the Soviet military personnel should be relinquished. Some observers consider that it was no coincidence that the decision to act in this way followed his contacts with the United States, but it is more likely that it was an entirely personal decision, based on his need to reduce the Soviet military presence which represented a danger to him and was causing unrest among the armed forces and among the population generally. It was also a gesture to the Americans. If the gesture failed, the military option still remained. The present author discussed these events with A.S. Kulik and V. M. Vinogradov:
A. S. KULIK: It is necessary to take into account the psychological feature of Sadat, his human complexes of a man who always wanted to be on top but who found himself in a subordinate position in Nasser. He was not even the second person in the country. When he came to power, he sought to do things the opposite of what Nasser had been doing. Hence his policy of rapprochement with the United States and peace with Israel and falling out with the USSR – even hostile attitude towards the USSR. Sadat’s personal psychological complexes combined with political calculation and sober mind of an Egyptian fellah.
THE AUTHOR: Did Sadat know that from the very beginning the Soviet leadership did not trust him?
V. M. VINOGRADOV: He felt it, of course, since on our side there were various kinds of delay both in our responses to his messages and in our actual deliveries. The Americans, who were aware of certain aspects of Sadat’s character – his hot temper, his suspiciousness, his hypochondria – made absolutely first-rate use of them. For example when a meeting was held in Moscow in May 1971 between Brezhnev and Nixon, Sadat was very apprehensive about it because he was nervous about an agreement being made behind his back. Then the communiqué was published. There was only one phrase in it, that both parties had agreed to, about entering into negotiations on the limiting of arms deliveries to the Middle East. There was nothing fearful in that. But it was direct evidence for him that we had tried to deceive him.

Up the down staircase 85
THE AUTHOR: Putting aside the emotions and the very unpleasant and annoying ways through which Sadat pursued matters with the USSR, was there in fact an objective basis for Egypt to reconsider its foreign policy priorities?
V. M. VINOGRADOV: Sadat had to choose a strategic course. It’s very likely that he understood that he wouldn’t get far with the Soviet Union. He knew about our restraint with regard to launching military actions. Our position was as follows; to help our friends. But it might bring us to international confrontation. Do we need a confrontation? No, we do not. One should act through political means. Sadat knew our arguments. And they irritated him. . . . The Americans did their political work in a masterly fashion. After Nixon came to power the Americans proclaimed themselves Egypt’s friends. They said: “Really, a misunderstanding has occurred, but we’ll help you if you give us advice on how to do it”. From being an external question, the liberation of occupied Sinai became a subject of internal political struggle for Sadat. His personal political authority was affected. Everybody in Egypt poked a bit of fun at Sadat. He didn’t understand at all. Nor was he a strong political leader. He just happened to find himself in the post of president by accident, by force of circumstance . . . . He wanted to look for a way to assert himself, to distance himself from the Soviet Union, so he began to raise innumerable claims and cavils against the Soviet Union. All the time he would be saying that the American aircraft were better than those of the Soviet Union, that their artillery and missiles were better, although this was debatable and open to question. In fact the October war of 1973 demonstrated the superiority of Soviet weaponry.
THE AUTHOR: Did the idea ever occur to you of possibly interfering, in certain circumstances, in Egypt’s internal political struggle?
V. M. VINOGRADOV: It was absolutely out of the question. The correct course was followed: it’s forbidden to interfere in internal affairs. Internal affairs are unpredictable, they’re the result of internal events.
THE AUTHOR: Did we infringe this principle anywhere in the Arab countries? V. M. VINOGRADOV: No, I don’t think we ever did. There were various troubles in
both Yemens, in Syria and Iraq and in the Sudan. Sudan has certainly seen a few coups d’état. But we have never interfered. THE AUTHOR: In the Arab countries did we ever commit sins like the CIA when it interfered in Iran’s affairs to overthrow Mossadeq? Of course, I’m not talking about the East European countries and Afghanistan. V. M. VINOGRADOV: Absolutely not. Our men aren’t trained for this.67
I was also interested in receiving the opinions of B. N. Ponomarev:
B. N. PONOMAREV: At the beginning Sadat signed a good agreement with us but he soon turned away from friendly relations, brought the situation to breaking point and then threw out our military servicemen and then the other specialists. He wasn’t a progressive, clever or literate person. And then, as for his wife . . . – she’s half British, perhaps from Cyprus. She was your typical

86 Up the down staircase
bourgeois female whose only goal in life was getting rich and in exalting Sadat to the skies. His daughter got married, as far as I remember, to a rich oil tycoon.
Apart from that Sadat suffered from alcoholism. It was uncommon for us to see it. But he drank strong drinks all the time; he liked vodka. Once I attended a reception in our embassy. The ambassador at the time was Vinogradov “the Second”, and Sadat said to him: “You don’t give me enough vodka, why don’t you send it to the Presidential palace?” Vinogradov promised to send him vodka by the case.
During the congress of the Arab Socialist Union, which I was attending, a coup d’état occurred in the Sudan. But Nimeiry’s partisans gathered their forces and arrested all the conspirators. I received a ciphered telegram from Moscow: “Win the help of Sadat to influence the Sudanese leadership so that they would not execute the leaders of the Communist Party”. We went with the ambassador to Sadat’s dacha which was about 40 kilometres from Cairo. He was sitting half undressed under a shady tree – it was very hot, about 40 degrees centigrade. A bottle of vodka and a bowl of ice were on the table. In that horrible heat! He invited us over to the table and filled up glasses for everybody. We drank only a bit but he put some ice in his and drained the glass to the dregs before our very eyes. We told him about our request. He went to make a telephone call, then he came back and said it was already too late . . . . He really was an alcoholic. Anybody who wanted to divert Egypt away from its friendly relations with the USSR obviously made use of the fact. Finally the patriotic forces organised themselves and did away with him. After that our relationship improved and got closer.68
I believe that the personal opinion of B.N. Ponomarev hardly needs any comment. The expulsion of Soviet military personnel from Egypt was viewed with mixed
feelings in Moscow. The liquidation of military positions in such a strategically important country as Egypt was painful for the Soviet leadership who clearly saw it as a political defeat. Even the method of their expulsion was an insult – after all they had originally been sent at the urgent request of Egypt itself. But at the same time there was a certain feeling of relief: the Soviet Union was moving away from the menace of direct involvement in military confrontation. The hope for detente had not died yet and Sadat’s decision did, as it happened, remove a stumbling block from the path of Soviet relations with the USA.
But when no “fee” for this dramatic gesture followed either from the USA or from Israel, Sadat understood that he could not avoid a war against Israel and that therefore it was still necessary to continue to cooperate with the USSR. In December 1972 he ordered his war minister Ahmad Ismaili to inform the Soviet ambassador in Cairo that the Egyptian-Soviet Agreement of 1968 on naval privileges would be extended for another five years.69 In Moscow, hopes for a continuation of the “special” relationship with Egypt still persisted. Military deliveries therefore proceeded at an appropriate level, and economic cooperation also continued.

A semi-victory turned into defeat
The decision to start a war against Israel was taken by Sadat and Asad in summer 1973. Both were running an enormous military and political risk, because of the lack of progress on the question of the withdrawal of Israeli troops and also because the failure to find an acceptable solution was putting them under intolerable pressure from domestic public opinion. The Egyptian and Syrian armed forces appeared to have learned a lesson from the defeat of the Six Day war in 1967 and had, with Soviet aid, restored their fighting efficiency. Morale seemed high, and at least a limited military success seemed possible. Of course the Egyptian and Syrian leadership understood that the US would not allow them totally to defeat Israel: nevertheless they hoped, as before, that in case they did not succeed, the Soviet Union would not allow its friends to be totally defeated either.
At 2.00 p.m. on 6 October 1973 air attacks were carried out against the Israeli positions in Sinai and on the Golan Heights. Egyptian troops crossed the Suez Canal and secured their positions on the east bank, and Syrian troops launched an offensive on the Golan Heights. The Israelis concentrated all their forces to the north and having destroyed almost all the Syrian tanks engaged in the attack, moved towards Damascus, being unable, however, to achieve air supremacy because of the rapid deployment by Syria, with Soviet assistance, of a modern airdefence system. During the Israeli counter-offensive in the north, the Egyptians troops in Sinai were essentially out of action. Israel, which considered the Egyptian front its main objective, having ceased intensive operations in Syria began to transfer its main forces south. Sadat ordered an offensive on 12 October but this was frustrated and the Egyptians had to retreat to their initial positions. Possibly there was apprehension about penetrating deeper eastwards into Sinai since the air-defence system covering them was deployed on the west bank of the Canal. Perhaps Sadat did not really want to advance Egyptian troops deep into Sinai.
By this time however Israel’s losses in personnel and armament had become so conspicuous that its leaders addressed a desperate request for assistance to the United States. At the point when America decided to set up a relief airlift Israel had in fact already lost about a third of its aircraft and more than a third of its tanks, and had reserves of some types of ammunition for only a few days.70 Its nuclear weapons “just in case” took up combat positions.
According to American sources, the reason for Israel’s major setbacks at the beginning of the war was a chain of blunders by Tel Aviv and Washington. First of all, it concerned the underestimation of the Egyptian army and misjudgements by the Israeli intelligence, whose information was also used by the CIA.
Sadat was much more cunning and foresighted than the Israelis and the Americans believed, and he was able to play for high stakes.
In July 2007, Ashraf Marwan, a son-in-law of Gamal Abdel Nasser, who kept a trusting relationship with Sadat, was killed in London under unclear circumstances. He had settled in the United Kingdom as a prosperous businessman, an arms dealer. It turned out that before the 1973 war he volunteered to become a paid agent of Israel. The authenticity of the top-secret documents of

88 Up the down staircase
national importance that he turned over to the Israelis very much impressed them. He became a trusted source. In 1973, he twice warned the Israelis about the intention of Egypt and Syria launch a war. Israel carried out expensive partial mobilizations – all in vain. The day before the start of the October War, Marwan once again informed Israel of the war plans of the Egyptian and Syrian leadership. At this time, the Israelis did not believe him and were caught unprepared. Were his activities as an Israeli spy an operation of the Egyptian leadership with a view to mislead Israel about the date of the attack? The funeral of Marwan was attended by President Mubarak’s son and Egyptian intelligence chief. They would not pay honours to Israel’s spy.71
In addition, Nixon was stuck in the Watergate scandal, and left foreign policy at the mercy of Kissinger, who was the first and last person in US history to combine the posts of National Security Advisor and Secretary of State. As Nixon wrote in his memoirs, the message from Golda Meir about the imminent start of war with Syria and Egypt that he had received in Key Biscayne (near Miami) “caught us completely by surprise”. Just the day before the CIA reported that the war in the Middle East is unlikely, and large movements of Egyptian troops were just regular annual manoeuvres.72
The whole drama of the situation, in which Israel found itself, did not immediately become clear to Kissinger, not to mention Nixon. In addition, Washington looked to Arab countries, especially Saudi Arabia, and there was a strong proArab lobby at the Pentagon, headed by Deputy Secretary of Defense William Clements, a Texas oilman. US Secretary of Defense George Schlesinger, who was competing for influence with Kissinger, supported him and in the early days was opposed to military supplies to Israel, believing that in the future it would prevent Washington from being an “honest broker” between Israel and the Arabs. However, at the time he and Kissinger, and Nixon himself were all convinced that the 1967 Six Day War scenario would repeat itself and the rapid defeat of the Arab by the Israelis would come. Therefore, there came no quick response to Tel Aviv’s pleas for help. On the night of 9 to 10 October, on the orders of Golda Meir, Israel’s ambassador to the United States S. Diniz, who was pleading Kissinger for help, quite transparently hinted that Israel was ready to take “extreme measures” . . . Later, it was confirmed that on that night, the Israeli Cabinet made the decision to arm Jericho missiles with nuclear warheads.73
According to Pentagon data 22,600 tons of armaments including tanks, artillery systems, missile and ammunition were sent between 13 October and 15 November, with deliveries being continued by sea.74
The Soviet leadership took the reasonable course at an early stage in the conflict of proposing that Sadat and Asad should seek a ceasefire since, given the advantageous positions occupied by the Egyptian and Syrian troops, they would be scoring a net victory even if the Israelis forced them to withdraw in some sectors.75 A moderate blow to Israel might also have suited the Americans if it had forced the Israeli leadership seriously to seek a peace agreement. But because its failures in the first days of the confrontation turned out to be worse than anticipated, Israel’s leaders had to wage a serious war and the Americans had no alternative but to

support their ally (client). The USSR had to do precisely the same, and assist Syria and Egypt. Four days after hostilities had begun the Soviet Union began one of the largest ever arms supply operations by air, and Antonov-12 and Antonov-22 transport planes made more than 900 flights ferrying weapons, combat vehicles and equipment and ammunition. Additional cargoes were sent by sea but began to arrive only towards the end of the war.
The USSR deployed a large fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean, estimated by the end of October at 96 units including 34 warships and 23 submarines,76 which was intended as warning to Israel not to attempt any disruption of Soviet supplies (a Soviet dry-cargo ship having been sunk in Latakia just at that time). The Soviet ships were obviously able to collect information on the development of the military operations and to keep an eye on the movements of the American Sixth Fleet. The West interpreted the strengthening of the Soviet Mediterranean squadron as a sign that it could be used to support Soviet troops should they be sent to the conflict area.
Soviet military personnel carried out the functions of non-combatants, driving tanks from the disembarkation ports to the front, operating radar-installations and repairing tanks, combat vehicles and other military equipment. The present author has no information that any Soviet advisers were actually engaged in fighting at the front. But I was in Damascus at the time and was told openly by Soviet military advisers that Soviet officers were operating the control-boards of the Syrian air-defence system which had been strengthened just after the Israeli raids on Damascus, and I can confirm that, having suffered rather considerable losses, the Israeli air force completed no further raids on the city.
A. N. Kosygin, member of the Politbureau and chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers was in Cairo between 16 and 19 October. He tried to convince Sadat that it was necessary to seek a ceasefire. The situation at the front was unfavourable to the Egyptians, and Sadat made such a proposal.
On 16 October the Israelis crossed the Suez Canal at a point between the two Egyptian field armies located in the area of the Great Bitter Lakes, and started an offensive along the East Bank of the Canal towards the Red Sea. As had been the case in 1967, they ignored the UN Security Council’s resolutions on a ceasefire until 25 October. It seemed likely that a couple more days would have seen them triumphing again. But the great unknown was how ready the Egyptian soldiers were to defend their territory – certainly the town of Suez was resisting heroically, while at the same time Soviet supplies were speedily restoring both Egyptian and Syrian losses in tanks and other armaments, Iraqi armoured units were advancing up to Syria, and Egypt was awaiting the arrival of troops from Algeria. However, it was the position of the USSR and the USA that played the main role in the ending of hostilities on the Egyptian-Israeli front on 25 October and on the SyrianIsraeli front the following day.
The UN Security Council discussed the Middle East situation on 9 and 12 October. The Soviet Union insisted that the solution lay first of all in the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the occupied Arab territories, and the USA demanded a ceasefire and withdrawal of both sides’ troops to the disengagement lines that had existed before the 1973 hostilities.

“No one is a wiser, more sophisticated, more subtle or more balanced student of Russian foreign policy than Dmitri Trenin. No one, anywhere. So, should the West fear Russia? His answer is, yes, but for reasons that are different and vastly more complex than the reasons driving the discourse in the West. US and European leaders will not get their policy toward Russia right until they come to terms with the arguments in this book.”
Robert Legvold, Columbia University, and author of Return to Cold War
“Dmitri Trenin makes a clear and compelling case that Russia’s Realpolitik may become more realistic and argues that the West should fear its weakness more than its strength. Trenin’s voice of reason makes an important and hopeful contribution to the current policy debate.”
Joseph S. Nye, Jr., University Distinguished Service Professor, Harvard University, and author of Is the
American Century Over?
“Dmitri Trenin is one of the most lucid analysts of Russia writing today. In this short but rich volume, he traces the recent history of misguided policy and conflicts of interest that have produced the current sharp deterioration in relations between Russia and the West. A ‘new normal’ has emerged, he argues. It is not a second Cold War but a period of new challenges and opportunities, in which seeing Russia clearly is critical to peace and security. To that end, there is no better place to start than this present essay.”

Preface
Since early 2014, barely a day passes when manifestations of Russia’s foreign policy assertiveness and military resurgence don’t make the headlines in the Western world. After Ukraine and Syria, it became absolutely clear: Russia has not only broken out of the post-Cold War order in its former Soviet neighborhood but challenged that order elsewhere. Two things stand out in Moscow’s recent actions: they caught a lot of people off guard, and they involved the use of force, sometimes in unorthodox ways. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the “Russia threat” is at the forefront of people’s minds. So, should Russia be feared?
The “we” in the title, of course, refers to the readers, wherever they live – in the United States, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, or elsewhere – who have become – or have always been, to various degrees – concerned about Russia. I was born in Moscow and live within a couple of miles from the Kremlin, the source of other people’s worries. And I pledge to you to give an honest answer to the question from inside the source of the perceived threat – no easy commission.
Many in Russia would scoff at the question, dismissing it as an example of Western paranoia, age-old Russophobia, a throwback to the Cold War, or a deliberate attempt at smearing Russia. Like most people anywhere, most ordinary Russians think of their country as essentially good, reasonably friendly, and essentially peace-loving – and, some will add, grossly misunderstood. Being able to look at one’s country from a distance is a rare and poisoned gift.
More sophisticated Russians would explain that the present-day Russian Federation has no intention of changing the world according to her preferences, unlike its immediate predecessor, the Soviet Union – or, some would not resist the temptation of saying, presentday America. Moscow, they would argue, is now guided by its interests rather than by ideologies. Russia is no real democracy, but it is part of the global capitalist economy and lives in a global information space. Its citizens are free to travel, and many have seen

other parts of the world, where no one is perfect. Bottom line: demonizing anyone serves no useful purpose.
“Realists” would point out that Russia is a post-imperial polity, in transit to a nation-state, and a great power; that it has a set of security interests that others need to take account of, whether they agree with them or not. Annexing Crimea, in their view, was a defensive move against the post-Cold War expansion of the West, and its legitimacy lies not so much in the legality of the annexation as in the genuine will of the bulk of the Crimean population to join Russia. To this group, Russia is an underdog power fighting for its survival as a major independent geopolitical entity against the far superior forces of its competitors.
Neither set of arguments finds many takers outside of Russia’s borders. To a lot of its neighbors, Russia as a security problem still looms larger than life. Tsarist, communist or contemporary, it is still feared, and often hated. Those living in countries which are bigger, farther away and more self-confident face the uncomfortable reality of a Russia which is intensely feared by some of their partners and which itself actively challenges the order underpinned by their senior transatlantic ally, in whom they entrusted their security seven decades ago.
In the United States, of course, there is no deep fear of Russia, deemed by the elite consensus a has-been power, now in terminal decline. In raw power terms, Russia is a midget compared to the US. Crucially, the fact that Russia, despite its many flaws and failings, remains a nuclear weapons peer of the United States and, as in the Cold War, practices nuclear deterrence toward the US, does not appear particularly threatening to Americans. Primitive North Korean systems and the non-existent Iranian ones raise much more concern in this regard. Despite the return of confrontation and the talk of Moscow’s unpredictability, Russia is evidently considered a rational player, at least in the nuclear field.
Thoughtful Americans would instead point to the numerous vulnerabilities of present-day Russia: the economic, social, political and ideological underpinnings of the current Russian system are all very weak. They would recall that the country imploded twice in the twentieth century, with disastrous consequences for itself and

powerful consequences, if very different each time, for others. Without a credible model of economic development and strong societal institutions, which are still absent, Russia may go down once again. If it does, implications for its neighbors will be severe and the impact on the rest of the world significant. Forget Russian strength, they would urge, watch out for its weakness!
Indeed, Russia’s insecurity is an issue. The current political system rests on the strong link between the leader, President Putin, and the bulk of the Russian people. Should that link be strained or severed, there is virtually no safety net. In 2015, the Kremlin’s chief political adviser said that, “as long as there [was] Putin, there [would be] Russia” – dubious laudation, if taken literally. Many of the moneyed elite are self-centered and self-indulgent. Much of the officialdom is using their positions for self-enrichment on the job. Russian society and polity has not yet concluded peace with itself: the “us” (common people) vs. “them” (elites) division runs deep. Russia’s conservatives, socialists and liberals are still dreaming of their own national hegemony and find little common ground, except, for most – after Crimea – in foreign policy.
Russia has not found peace with its near neighbors either. The Ukrainian conflict continues to smolder, Georgia is nervous, Poland and the Baltic States are openly hostile, and Turkey in November 2015 shot down a Russian warplane, causing a breakdown in the heretofore vibrant relations between the two. To the west, it faces a Europe where NATO has openly resumed its historical mission of containing Russia; to the east, it sees a China that has risen to the point when it has decided to begin economic expansion in Eurasia, as part of the “One Belt, One Road” project. To the south, Russia watches with growing concern the expansion of Islamist radicalism and extremism, which it had hoped to check by means of a military operation in Syria.
The hard fact in 2016 is that Russia’s relations with much of the rest of Europe are marked by mutual alienation, and its asymmetrical confrontation with the United States is both serious and dangerous. Partial convergence of Russian and Western interests in Syria cannot alter the fundamental clash of interests. Mutual hostility is palpable, and the chances of a direct collision between Russia and the United

States are not negligible. The thick atmosphere of Russo-American rivalry, no matter how unequal, breeds even more mistrust, suspicion and fear. Even if the worst doesn’t come to the worst, the effect will be significant, and lasting.
The Russia–Europe rift is particularly damaging to Russia, newly estranged from Europe. It isn’t a welcome thing for Europe, either. For centuries, Russia was the “east of the West”, an extension of Europe all the way to the Pacific. After the end of the Cold War, a prospect arose of a “greater Europe” that would include Russia and would rest on a symbiosis of Russian resources and European technologies. What could happen, however, is a Russia as the “west of the East”, dominated by China and embracing much of Eurasia. This would shift the geopolitical axis of the Eurasian continent precisely as it is becoming increasingly more intertwined.
The problem with Russia is that it doesn’t fit neatly in one box. It is both strong and weak; authoritarian and lawless; traditionalist and valueless. Everything there may change overnight, and nothing will do so in two hundred years. No wonder that one can fear one’s own past fears, dreading their comeback. Russia’s imperial past and Stalin’s long shadow have never quite left its neighbors’ minds alone, even in the days of Russia dismantling its historical empire and shedding its worn communist clothes. Seen through these lenses, Putin looks just the last man in the long line going all the way back to Ivan the Terrible.
So much for the complexities of the question and for the difficulties of answering it, neither of which should be construed as an excuse for fudging the issue. I will attempt to address the question squarely, knowing full well that your interest in the answer is anything but academic. A short version sounds like this. Most fears about Russia are dated or groundless. At the same time, a lot of dangers linked to America’s or Europe’s relations with it are all too happily ignored. In other words: Russia should not be feared but, rather, always be handled with care. If you are interested in an answer which is a bit longer, you are welcome to read further.
Dmitri Trenin Sergiev Posad, 8 February 2016

Introduction
The Ukraine crisis of 2014 drew a line under the quarter century of virtually unprecedented Russian–Western cooperation, which began with the end of the Cold War and Russia’s shaking off communism. After events in Ukraine, in the view of a number of serious and seasoned observers, the Cold War has staged a comeback. These observers point to the new political front lines being drawn in Europe, this time in its eastern part rather than in the center of the continent. They see this new divide solidifying into a zone of military confrontation. They add that the values gap between the West and Russia is as real as the old ideological confrontation between liberal democracy and communism. Finally, with Russia aligning itself with China and Iran, as well as with authoritarian regimes from Belarus to Syria to Venezuela to Zimbabwe, there is an element of globalism in the new stand-off.
I, on the contrary, do not find the Cold War analogy very useful. Not so much because of the obvious differences between then and now – the absence of an iron curtain; the off-center rather than pivotal global importance of US–Russian relations compared to US–Soviet ones; or the much reduced salience of the ideological factor. As someone who vividly remembers the Cold War, I am concerned that analogies which are too close to that period in history can create patterns of thought that would be misleading and result in preventable mistakes. People would be preparing for things which would not happen, while missing those that would. The situation in Western–Russian relations now may be as bad, and as dangerous, as at any time during the Cold War, but it is bad and dangerous in its own new way.
The absence of an iron curtain makes information space a prime battlefield in the new competition between the Russian state-run propaganda and the Western mainstream media. The still largely open space makes this 24/7 battle extremely dynamic and particularly ruthless, with virtually no holds barred. Information is no longer suppressed, but it is difficult or sometimes impossible to tell truth from falsehood.

Geo-economics, alongside information space, has become a key area of Russian–Western confrontation. Contrary to liberal expectations, interdependence – i.e., between Russia and the EU – has neither prevented nor dampened the conflict over Ukraine. If anything, interdependence made the rupture more painful than during the Cold War. Russia’s integration into the global economy allows for a more effective use of Western economic sanctions in an effort to make the Kremlin change its course.
The obvious asymmetry in power and status between Russia and the United States leads Moscow to elect the field which it finds more comfortable – military action – and to put a premium on the swiftness and boldness of its own steps. The absence of a balance turns the rivalry into a competition of wills, where the Kremlin also capitalizes on the absolute dominance of the Russian president in the national decision-making process. And the values gap, unlike the ideological divide of the past, makes it virtually impossible for the United States, occupying in its own thinking the moral high ground, to reach a compromise with so unworthy an adversary. These are elements which make the current rivalry more fluid and less predictable than the Cold War stand-off.
Whether one prefers to refer to the Cold War or not, one has to admit that mutual adversity between the West and Russia is the new normal, which is likely to last. Trust was not really achieved even in the period of cooperation, but deep distrust comes now with the utter lack of respect, not even of the kind sometimes accorded to an enemy. There is no element of balance either. The Soviet–Western competition is long over, with the West having declared itself the victor. To treat Russia as an equal would not only be wrong as a matter of fact; it would be wrong in moral terms and, whoever might do so, compromises the values of the West. Among the dangers facing the civilized world, US President Barack Obama famously put Russia somewhere between a contagious disease and a terrorist grouping.
This adversity is likely to continue beyond the lifetime of the Obama administration. The forty-fifth US president could actually be tougher on Russia than the forty-fourth one. One hears in Washington that pressure on Moscow will last at least as long as

Vladimir Putin’s reign in Russia – which may be a long wait. It is an interesting question what might happen if Russia, as some people hope, cracks under Western pressure and capitulates. If it does not, however, it is hard to imagine that Putin or a successor will roll back the Kremlin’s policies enough to win a “normalization” of relations with the United States. There can be some provisional “fix” in Donbass, but there will be no return to the halcyon days of Russia’s attempted integration into the West in the 1990s, or its equally unfulfilled ambition of forging alliances with the United States and NATO in the 2000s.
The current predicament in Russian–Western relations is anything but fortuitous. European history proves, rather convincingly, that a post-conflict failure to integrate a former enemy, particularly if it is a major power, or at least to make it feel secure and at ease, results in a new conflict roughly a generation away. The way World War I ended made World War II very likely. By contrast, post-World War II integration of West Germany into the US-led system of alliances and the European Common Market essentially resolved the “German Question” that had plagued Europe since the second half of the nineteenth century. With the Cold War being a conflict of a scale, intensity and duration – but not casualties, of course – comparable to a world war, the failure of Russia’s Western integration, which was evident from the mid-2000s, bode ill. People were warned and should have been alarmed.
Things are never so simple, though, and any historical analogies need to be taken with a huge grain of salt. One cardinal difference between post-World War II West Germany and post-Cold War Russia is that the Germans fully accepted US leadership and eagerly fitted into the US-led “free world” as model pupils, as the phrase went then. The Russians, on the contrary, after a very brief period of demonstrating their willingness to embrace US values and interests as their own, began to clamor for a co-equal position in the post-Cold War order, or at minimum for full recognition of their special security interests the way they themselves defined them. In other words, they demanded power-sharing at the top of the system, or at least special privileges within it.

Neither was, or could have been, on offer. Russia of the 1990s, as the prime successor to the Soviet Union, was, in realist terms, a defeated power in all but name; it was also exceedingly weak and seemingly growing weaker; and it was much nearer to the bottom than to the top of the post-communist democracy/market class. The more insightful Americans and Europeans soon concluded that Russia would not make a good – i.e., reliable – ally, in the image of Germany. If allowed into NATO, Russia would probably have undermined the American leadership by its outsize demands and its mischievous propensity to build coalitions against the US – with Germany, France and others. A keen sense of great-power sovereignty was still in the DNA of the Russian political class; the absence of a military defeat at the close of the Cold War – and, instead of post-conflict “re-education,” the liberal talk of a “victory for all” – clouded and confused popular perceptions; and the enormity of the task of Russian modernization made Russia not only a hopeless but also an undesirable ally.
While Russia was turning out to be “beyond the pale,” the West proceeded to build a “Europe whole and free” without Russia by expanding its principal institutions in the area, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union. To the Clinton administration and liberal internationalists across the West, extending NATO and the EU east of the Cold War divide made a lot of sense, as the countries in the region were eager to accede to the West and, while in the process of accession, to adopt Western ways of doing things. Such integration was also the best way of preventing conflicts among the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
As a result, by the late 2000s, virtually all of Europe outside the former Soviet Union had evolved into a single economic, political, security and humanitarian space. The oft-asked but never clearly answered question about the borders of Europe was being solved on the ground, not in the discussion fora. Russia’s designated role was that of a partner of, not a party to, the expanded West.
To the Russian foreign and security policy community, such treatment was nothing less than insult added to injury. Some bemoaned the “Versailles-like” conditions allegedly imposed on Russia. Nearly all fulminated at the “perfidious” Western scheme of

bringing NATO all the way to Russia’s doorstep, supposedly in contravention of promises made by US and Western European leaders to Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev at the time of Germany’s reunification in 1990.
These Russian claims, however, rested on shaky foundations. Rather than being castigated and turned into a pariah à la post-Versailles Germany, Russia inherited the Soviet seat at the UN Security Council and all of the USSR’s nuclear arsenal, joined the G7 (which thus became G8), the Council of Europe, and the World Trade Organization, and acquired privileged status as a partner of both NATO and the EU – all with the West’s assistance. True, the Soviet Union’s $100 billion debt to the West was not forgiven, unlike Poland’s, but Russia was not saddled with reparations and retributions. Moreover, having had – and been able – to pay its debt eventually saved Russia’s pride.
Essentially, Russian grievances against its Western partners fall into two categories. The first one is mostly to do with the West’s refusal to appreciate what Russia did to end the Cold War – from allowing Eastern Europe to “go its own way” to shaking off communism and dismantling the Soviet Union at home – together with its failure to integrate Russia into its midst and to give it an elevated status there. The other one reproaches the West for its refusal to treat Russia as a great power in its own right, complete with a sphere of interests around its borders, and immune from Western interference in its own affairs. Both sets of grievances misread the nature of international relations.
The Russian complainers ignore the hard fact that the Soviet Union utterly lost the economic, ideological and political competition with the West and that, instead of the “convergence” of the two systems, as Andrei Sakharov and many other intellectuals had hoped, and a sort of “bi-hegemony” of Moscow and Washington, as Gorbachev’s advisers anticipated, the West celebrated a complete and total victory and the United States entered a period of global dominance unprecedented in history. In the final stages of the Cold War, Moscow gave in to Washington’s demands not only in the issues of arms control and geopolitics but also in human rights, economic freedoms and the treatment of the Baltic republics. Russians

demanded recognition for their seemingly graceful but actually painful exit from communism and the empire and claimed a status no longer supported by the realities at hand, but these things could not have been had for the asking.
The United States and its allies were fully triumphant. Robert Gates, then CIA director, called his drive into the Kremlin in 1992 for talks a “victory lap.” He later reflected that
[F]rom 1993 onward, the West, and particularly the United States, [had] badly underestimated the magnitude of Russian humiliation in losing the Cold War and then in dissolution of the Soviet Union, which amounted to the end of the centuries-old Russian Empire. The arrogance, after the collapse, of American government officials, academicians, businessmen, and politicians in telling the Russians how to conduct their domestic and international affairs (not to mention the internal psychological impact of their precipitous fall from superpower status) had led to deep and long-term resentment and bitterness.1
The end of the Cold War, however, signaled more the defeat of the Soviet system, which had become unsustainable in a number of key areas, starting from economics, than a victory for the West. The defeat of the system was mainly the work of the Russian elites and people, who, alongside others – Armenians, Balts, Georgians, Ukrainians – opened a new beginning for themselves, although at a high price. The fact that the metropolitan territory of an empire led the way out of it is a rare occurrence in world history.
To blame the West for the downfall of the USSR is factually wrong. US President George H. W. Bush’s July 1991 speech in Kiev, in which he urged the Ukrainians to remain in the Soviet Union, revealed the keen understanding in Washington of the dangers inherent in a collapse of a nuclear superpower. The utterly false claims of US responsibility for the disintegration of the USSR put Russians into the position of fake victims, while diminishing their twin historical accomplishments – or responsibility, depending on where one stands on these issues – for a peaceful end to the seven decades of communist dictatorship and a voluntary dissolution of the 300-yearold empire.

As for the NATO argument, the West’s mistake was not that its leaders had broken any formal commitments – which were nonexistent – or informal promises – which were exceedingly vague and widely open to interpretation – to their Soviet counterpart, but that it lacked a credible strategy toward a major power left outside of its expanding alliances and feeling the discomfort of it, to say the least. This discomfort could be papered over, managed and minimized, but eventually it led to a sudden pushback.
With hindsight, some senior Western statesmen concede that, in the words of Robert Gates, “moving so quickly after the collapse of the Soviet Union to incorporate so many of its formerly subjugated states into NATO was a mistake.” To Gates, “NATO expansion was a political act, not a carefully considered military commitment, thus undermining the purpose of the alliance and recklessly ignoring what the Russian considered their own vital national interests.”2 However, this realist assessment was a minority view at the time of making decisions about NATO’s enlargement.
Essentially, the failure to understand the consequences of expanding the NATO security area while leaving Russia outside it was rooted in the widely held belief that the “end of history” had arrived: that classical geopolitics no longer applied in the globalized world, that, in the post-Cold War environment, compromising with authoritarian regimes, especially about third parties, meant compromising one’s own core principles, and that anyway Russia was on a declining path. Conventional wisdom suggested that Russia had no option but to take the world as it is, and adjust to it, by bandwagoning on the West.
This, however, was not the way things looked from the Kremlin. In his 2007 speech to the Munich Security Conference, President Putin strongly denounced US post-Cold War global dominance and vowed to resist it. The five-day war between Russia and Georgia in 2008 sent a chilling message that the safe limits of NATO’s enlargement to the east had been reached. The reset in US–Russian relations which followed in 2009–10 during Barack Obama’s first presidential term was useful, but shallow and non-strategic – thus reversible. At the same time, the power of Russian patriotism and nationalism, subdued and suppressed in the first post-Cold War decade, began to

surge. Vladimir Putin became its standard bearer, seeking to consolidate both his hold on power and the unity of the country at large.
The relationship with the United States meanwhile stagnated, and then began rapidly to deteriorate. In 2014, push came to shove. A conflict broke out over Ukraine, which, in the words of Robert Gates, was a “monumental provocation” to Moscow. Historical connections between Russia and Ukraine, going back over a thousand years, were ignored; Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s warnings that US support for regime change in Kiev would destroy US–Russian relations were brushed off.3 The US–Russian showdown could have happened in a different place and at a different moment, but the fact that it occurred over a country which was so important for Russia made it certain that it would be very serious, very painful, and last a very long time.
The Ukraine crisis was not the first war in Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1999, NATO air forces bombed Yugoslavia, including Belgrade, for seventy-eight days to make the Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević back down in Kosovo, a majority-Albanian province which as a result proclaimed independence. The Kosovo crisis was preceded by three years of war in neighboring Bosnia, which claimed 200,000 lives, and which also saw NATO aerial engagements on behalf of the Croats and Muslims and against the Serbs. The Balkan conflicts, however, were safely insulated: they were fought by the locals, managed by the West, and – because of Russia’s material weakness and its still continuing effort at adjustment to the new realities – did not lead to a great-power stand-off. Europe was burning at the edges but felt basically safe, having had to cope only with the stream of refugees, which seems small and orderly by today’s standards.
Ukraine, fifteen years later, was different. Russia proceeded swiftly first to secure the Crimean peninsula, help stage a popular referendum there, and then to annex it. The success of the Russian military operation stunned outside observers. The enlargement of Russian territory evoked neighbors’ memories of the past. Using the techniques dubbed hybrid warfare by the Western media, Russia supported an armed rebellion in the Donbass region in the east of Ukraine and prevented Kiev from crushing it.

By sending its warplanes close to NATO countries’ borders, and allowing them to fly close to Western aircraft and ships, Russia sent a clear message to Western countries that, unlike in the Balkan wars, they would not be able to sit it out and watch Slavs kill one another. In the event of an escalation of the conflict, the Kremlin appeared to be saying, NATO countries too would be affected. To make the message even clearer, Putin publicly mentioned later that he had been considering putting Russia’s nuclear weapons on high alert. Russia and the West came closer to a head-on collision than had been the case in at least three decades: 2014 was the most dangerous year in Europe since the 1983 Able Archer exercise, if not since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.
2015 put a freeze on the conflict in Donbass, which reduced the dangers of dangerous escalation but made the Russia–NATO standoff permanent. Following the Wales summit of September 2014, NATO’s contingency planning was revised to take account of a Russia now seen as hostile. Western and Russian forces began to exercise close to each other’s territory, and NATO’s eastern members – Poland, the Baltic States and Romania – received token Western troop deployments and some heavy weapons. The NATO secretary general’s 2016 annual report referred to resurgent Russia as a major security challenge to the alliance. Senior US military commanders and defense officials began to refer to Russia as an adversary, which soon became routine. Ashton Carter, the US defense secretary, named Russia as the number one security issue to the United States, ahead of China, North Korea, Iran and ISIL.4
On the Russian side, there was no dispute as to who was the principal adversary. The National Security Concept adopted on New Year’s Eve 2016 referred to the US and NATO actions as a security threat. To the Russian General Staff, however, the “moment of truth” about the United States and other nominal Western partners had already taken place years ago, over Kosovo.
In 2015, Russia made another step to challenge the US-led order by intervening militarily in Syria and hitting in the process some of the groups supported by the United States and its allies. The Russians not only broke the US monopoly on global military intervention. By inserting themselves in the midst of a war which had already

involved a US-led coalition, they complicated the Western operations in Syria and Iraq, made common cause with Iran, raised the prospect of a war by proxy, briefly evoked the possibility of a quasi-alliance with France, caused a political collision with Ankara when Turkey downed a Russian bomber, and forced Washington to treat Moscow as an indispensable party to both the war and peace in Syria. Forcing his way to the high table, and making others deal with him out of necessity if not of choice, has become Vladimir Putin’s diplomatic trademark in his relations with US leaders.
This combative foreign policy is being waged against the background of an unmistakably authoritarian Russian domestic regime, which prides itself in following the conservative tradition and publicly rejects some of the latter-day European values, particularly on the issues of gay rights, family, religion, migration, and the role of the state. It is supported by a competent and effective information/propaganda apparatus that contributes to the massive approval of Putin’s ratings at home and reaches out beyond Russia’s borders. Even though Russia’s global popularity is low, which is hardly surprising given Western global information dominance, some of Moscow’s themes find an audible echo in many parts of the world, from China to Latin America to the Middle East to Europe.
So, a blunt and cheerful “no” to the question in the title of this book looks both naïve and irresponsible. Surely, adversarial relations with a major power always carry risks. If the country in question is a major military power, with a huge nuclear arsenal, the risks are so much higher. If it is an authoritarian country whose decision-making is ultra-centralized and secretive, whose policies are sometimes hard to read, and whose actions are designed to catch others off guard, anxieties can turn to fears. This is precisely Russia’s image in the public mind. Fear, however, is a poor guide to sound policies, or even to proper understanding. Fear could also be a problem in itself.
I begin this book with an analysis of existing Russia-related fears: their causes, their roots and their rationality. I will examine closely the things which make Westerners fear Russia and try to assess the proper dimensions of the factors behind the concerns, anxieties and worries. The conclusion from the opening chapter, I can tell even now, is that, while most fears need to be put to rest, the Russian

challenge to the US-dominated/led world order is real, serious and long term.
The next stage will be to explore the nature of the Russian challenge. What is Russia really up to in its neighborhood and beyond – e.g., in the Middle East? What is it that its leader and elites want? To what extent is Russia’s foreign policy a mere tool of the Kremlin’s regime preservation, as some, including in Russia, claim? Other key questions include: How much does Russia’s challenge matter to the United States and Europe, in the global scheme of things? And can Russia sustain it? The author’s answer to the last question is probably “yes”, and that both Russia and the challenge it is posing to the current US-dominated global system should not be discounted.
This leads to the logical question of dealing with the challenge. There have been efforts at consolidating allies and partners, isolating and sanctioning Russia, helping Beijing keep a distance from Moscow, and countering the Kremlin propaganda. How effective have these been? What is the outlook for these essentially punitive policies? What chances of success does the hardline approach – keep the pressure on until Moscow’s will breaks – have? Compared to that, do the pragmatists stand a better chance of getting a satisfactory arrangement? Various scenarios will be offered.
Since the stand-off is serious, how can the risks be reduced? What confidence-building measures need to be taken? What channels of communication need to be used to send and receive messages without danger of a fateful misunderstanding? While accommodation with Russia will carry a cost that few in the West today, particularly the United States, are prepared to pay, is some modus vivendi with Russia possible? How to be able jointly to oppose Islamist extremism, terrorism, and WMD proliferation while continuing to live in the wider environment of confrontation?
Finally, what about the Russians themselves? How do they see their place and role in the twenty-first-century world? How genuine and how permanent is their shift to Asia? In the emerging Greater Eurasia, from the Pacific to the Atlantic, is Russia the east of the West, or is it becoming the west of the East, and does this matter at all? What would a future relationship with the United States and the European Union look like from a Russian perspective? How would

that fit into the general universe of Moscow’s foreign policy? Should the Russians fear the West?

1 Analysis of Fears
Fears of Russia in the West predate the Cold War (1947), the formation of the Red Army (1918) and the Bolshevik revolution (1917). A good summary of them could be found in an article by Frederick Engels in 1890, “The Foreign Policy of Russian Tsarism.”5 To Engels and his colleague Karl Marx, the principal source of fear was the expansionist nature of the Russian state, which, in its quest for hegemony in Europe and Asia, devoured some of its neighbors and subjugated others. Russia’s rampant expansionism was made even more repugnant by the authoritarian and repressive character of its domestic regime.
This view from the West has not changed much, despite the peaceful toppling of the communist system by the Russian people in August 1991 and the unprecedented voluntary dismantlement of the historical Soviet/Russian empire in 1989–91. This process was not only led by Moscow, which accepted that 25 million ethnic Russians would be left outside the Russian Federation, it also drastically reduced the country’s armed forces and scaled back the defense industry. Today, the Russian state often continues to be credited with an “essentially predatory nature,” with a clear “preference to squeezing foreign countries to patient construction at home.”6
Imperial revival
Just before Hillary Clinton stepped down as US secretary of state at the start of Barack Obama’s second term, she called Vladimir Putin’s project of a Eurasian Union an attempt to restore the Soviet Union. Beneath the veneer of “regional integration,” Putin’s goals, in her view, were “rebuilding a lost empire” and “re-Sovietizing” the Russian periphery; his method, like that of his predecessors, was “always testing, and pushing one’s boundaries.”7
Whether Putin was aiming at a new edition of the empire or at some loosely defined Moscow-led “power center in Eurasia,” one thing was

clear. After a brief delusion in the early 1990s when Russia’s foreign minister confided in a former US president, who was stunned by the confession, that Russia did not have interests that differed from the common interests of the democratic West, Moscow has learned not only to define its own interests but also to assert them. The most vital of these interests have always been concentrated in the territory of the former Soviet Union.
Russia’s break with its empire was not immediately considered as final. As far back as 1994 Henry Kissinger warned about the risk of the “reimperialization” of Russia.8 The very use of such an unwieldy term suggests that it was carefully chosen. The United States, with a long history of helping others – starting with the British – divest themselves of their colonial possessions, was clearly pursuing the same policy with regard to post-Soviet Russia. It was one thing for George H. W. Bush to fear the collapse of a nuclear superpower; once the division of the Soviet Union became official, and its nukes were secured, Washington became a supporter of the new states’ genuine independence from the Russian Federation. Moscow’s initial instinct to treat its ex-borderlands as something not-quite-foreign, captured in the phrase “near abroad,” immediately became suspicious and had to be resisted.
The new states themselves, for their part, sought to rely on US and, to a lesser degree, European support to protect their independence, which still looked too fragile. The West leaned hard on Moscow to make sure that the Russian forces left the Baltic States by 1994. By that year, the last remaining Russian garrisons had left Germany and Eastern Europe. Once their departure was completed, the Russian military presence in Europe, in geographical terms, reached its lowest ebb in three centuries. Moreover, almost immediately, the opposite tide began, as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic applied in the same year to join NATO. To many Russians, this was zero-sum at its starkest: even as Russia’s power was receding, it was being replaced by the expanding power of the West. No vacuum, no middle ground was allowed to exist. When Moscow began to protest against NATO’s eastern enlargement, however, these protests were interpreted by the West as imperial nostalgia, another cause for concern.

Meanwhile, other fears arose as some of the former Soviet republics experienced ethnic separatism. In newly independent Moldova and Georgia, separatist groups have come to rely on the military protection of the Russian army garrisons and political and economic support from Moscow. Even though ad hoc peacekeeping arrangements were reached soon after initial clashes, Russian forces in Transnistria, Abkhazia and South Ossetia were regarded by Chisinau and Tbilisi as occupiers, impinging on their newborn sovereignty and threatening their independence. To those with long memories, the Russian Federation was clawing back the territories of the former Soviet Union, much like Soviet Russia in 1918–20 was “reintegrating” the former imperial borderlands, snuffing out their short-lived independence. Thus, the most serious fear of Russia is that of Russian imperialism.
Use of force
A major contributor to the fear factor is the Kremlin’s willingness to use military force, starting in the Russian North Caucasus in the 1990s and the early 2000s against local separatists turned extremists, which many in the West chose to see in terms of a colonial power fighting a national liberation movement. “The Kremlin has shown,” said the historian Norman Davies, “that it is quite prepared to use armed force; the West has shown that it is not.” Davies meant, not against Russia: US and other Western militaries had been consistently using force since the early 1990s. The problem, of course, was the practical impossibility of attacking a nuclear superpower. This, in Davies’s view, “creates an asymmetrical relationship with Russia, militarily weak but mentally decisive, which can expect to get almost anything it wants.”9 Although this is obviously an overstatement, it points to a key problem: for all its military superiority that it has been using elsewhere quite liberally, the United States lacks serious military options vis-à-vis Russia.
One thing Vladimir Putin has learned from the history of both Gorbachev’s and Yeltsin’s dealings with the West, is never to be weak, and never to appear weak. “The weak get beaten.” Even if the odds are against Russia, Putin is punching above the country’s weight rather than submitting himself to the will of others. Over

time, Putin went further. Summing up his own experience of fifteen years at the helm of the Russian state, he concluded that, if a fight is inevitable, one needs to strike first. Looking from the Kremlin, over the years Russia had drawn a number of red lines to its partners, which they chose to ignore. Finally, this provoked Moscow’s pushback. In Putin’s view, his predecessors’ main mistake was not being assertive enough in defending the country’s national interests.
These red lines, first drawn by Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov in 1996, referred to the issue of admitting ex-members of the Warsaw Pact, which had formed the Soviet Union’s strategic glacis in Europe, to NATO. The combination of Russian opposition to NATO’s enlargement and its support for self-proclaimed separatist states led in 2008 to the first large-scale use of Russian military power since the demise of the Soviet Union. The Russian forces were brought into action by the botched attempt by the impetuous Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili to re-establish control over the rebel region of South Ossetia, which led to the killing of a number of Russian peacekeepers there.
Once the war began, Russian troops did not confine themselves to the immediate area of conflict but proceeded to occupy areas of Georgia proper, coming within a striking distance of the Georgian capital Tbilisi. The point made, they were ordered to stop. Soon thereafter, Moscow formally recognized the separatist statelets of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, thus redrawing the post-Soviet borders for the first time. This was a loud warning shot. However, it was soon muted by the avalanche of the global financial crisis. A short-lived reset between Washington and Moscow followed.
In a somewhat similar move, reacting to the 2014 Maidan revolution in Kiev, which brought to power pro-Western elements within the Ukrainian elite in a coalition with western Ukrainian nationalists, Russian forces took control of Crimea (where Russia had long had a naval base), threatened to use military force elsewhere in Ukraine, staged a referendum in majority-Russian Crimea on joining Russia, formally incorporated the peninsula into the Russian Federation as a result, and actively supported an armed rebellion in Ukraine’s southeastern Donbass region. This time, Russia not only redrew borders; it annexed territory, claiming the right to protect the interests of its

co-ethnics. Many countries with Russian minorities became immediately concerned, from the Baltic States in NATO to Russia’s own allies in the Collective Security Treaty Organization such as Belarus and Kazakhstan.
Restoration of military power
Moscow’s more assertive foreign policy has been backed up by a reconstituted military force. After the 2008 Georgia war, Russian military reform began in earnest, and the decline of Russian military power which had lasted two decades began to be reversed. In 2010, a large-scale program of military modernization was adopted, with the stated aim of raising the share of “modern” weapons and equipment in the Russian arsenal from 30 to 70 percent by 2020. Military training and exercises were substantially upgraded. Russian military aircraft resumed routine patrols along the borders of the United States, the United Kingdom and other NATO countries, as well as Japan.
Even as Russia’s power began to grow, Moscow refused to live by the constraints imposed on it in its hour of weakness. When NATO countries refused to ratify the adapted Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty, raising objections of the Russian military presence in Georgia and Moldova, Russia suspended its implementation of the original 1990 CFE document, which was negotiated when the Warsaw Pact was still around and which limited Russian troop movements within its own territory. With neither the adapted nor the original CFE treaty in operation, the risks of a surprise attack in Europe have grown.
The actual employment of force in Crimea in 2014 and in Syria in 2015 returned Russia to the ranks of major conventional military powers. The Crimea operation featured a very different military than the one that saw battle in Georgia six years previously, not to speak of the decayed army that fought in Chechnya in the 1990s. The actual use of Russian air and naval power in Syria was even more impressive. Russia’s post-Cold War military weakness has become history. Countries with strained relations with Moscow had to take notice.

Yet this concern needs to be put in perspective. Russia’s military power is a far cry from that of the United States. The Russian military budget is a small fraction of America’s. It trails far behind China’s. Except in the category of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, there is no balance between Russia and the US, not to speak of a comparison with NATO. The new emerging front line in Europe passes just a hundred miles west of St Petersburg. Kaliningrad is completely surrounded on land by NATO territory. Similarly, the scale and intensity of Russia’s military operations, from the Balkans to the Middle East, are dwarfed by those of the United States and its allies. And Russia has practically no allies.
Hybrid warfare
Many Russians have recently grown accustomed to quoting Emperor Alexander III, that Russia has only two friends in the world – its army and its navy. However, to protect and actively promote its interests, Russia is not relying solely on its military instruments. In the areas of conflict in the post-Soviet space, it has used a number of local allies – pro-Russian political formations, businesses and paramilitary groups – as well as bona fide volunteers and military advisers, specialists and other personnel from Russia. This heterogeneous combination of assets has made it possible to wage what has been called in the West “hybrid warfare” – in reality, the combined employment of military, paramilitary and non-military means in support of political objectives, which also made it more difficult to accuse Russia of direct military intervention.
The use of these assets in Crimea allowed Moscow to claim absolute victory “without firing a shot.” In Donbass, the situation was less favorable to Russia, and Moscow’s intervention carried a risk of escalation to an all-out war. However, the Kremlin managed to keep its direct military involvement on the ground to the minimum required to keep the cities of Donetsk and Lugansk off limits to Kiev’s forces and to preserve the vital cross-border link between the rebel republics and the Russian Federation. Throughout the active phase of the conflict, Moscow carefully stuck to the position of “plausible deniability” with regard to its actual involvement. The Kremlin summarily dismissed Western accusations of lying, basically

assuming that, after the breach of trust between Russia and the West in Ukraine, few holds there were barred.
“Hybrid warfare,” Crimea- or Donbass-style, however, can hardly be used where it is feared most: in the Baltic States and Poland. Moscow’s intentions aside, the local Russians’ self-identification with the Russian Federation cannot be compared to that of the Crimeans. Even though naturalization in Latvia and Estonia was made hard for local Russians, they are not looking to Moscow for protection and guidance. Daugavpils is not Donetsk-in-waiting, and Narva is no Lugansk. Poland is an even more far-fetched case. The Donbass model is not easily transferable, and employing it on the territory of a NATO member state denies the Kremlin any rationality whatsoever.
The energy weapon
The continuing steep rise in oil prices from 2000 to 2008 gave some Russians an idea that their resource-rich country could be an energy superpower, and its oil and particularly gas exports might be used as a tool of foreign policy – or, to put it simply, as an energy weapon. Rather maladroitly, Moscow used the threat of cutting off gas, which it sometimes executed, as a powerful argument in disputes with postSoviet neighbors about energy price and other commercial issues. Not infrequently, these issues were richly mixed with politics, as in Ukraine after the Orange revolution in 2006 and 2009. In those disputes, the Western media and the public invariably sided with the victims of Gazprom’s energy blockades. Even though Russia never stopped supplying its Western customers with gas – not even at the time of the Soviet Union’s collapse – its reputation as a reliable supplier suffered.
As relations with Moscow began to sour in the mid-2000s, the West’s dependence on Russian gas supplies – roughly 30 percent of the EU’s imports – became a security concern, particularly in Poland, the Baltic States, Sweden, Britain and the United States. The fear here was that, by making Europe’s countries, including the EU powerhouse Germany, dependent on Russian gas supplies, Moscow was achieving undue influence over their policies and left other countries such as Poland and the Baltic States exposed to Russian

diktat. What the United States, Poland and the Baltics really feared, however, was a Russo-German economic symbiosis – which Putin was advocating – that would ultimately lead to Germany distancing itself from America, taking on a more independent international role, and becoming more “understanding” of Russia’s geopolitical interests.
Particularly suspicious to the critics were direct Russian–German energy links, such as the North Stream gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea, which did not cross any third country territory, and thus, the fear ran, Gazprom held the countries in between – Poland and Lithuania – to ransom. A similar Gazprom plan to build a pipeline, dubbed the South Stream, to Italy and Austria across the Black Sea and the Western Balkans would have gone around Ukraine and left it in the lurch, making it a blind alley and also robbing cash-strapped Kiev of transit fees. The plan, moreover, might also have increased Russian influence in the Balkans and Southern Europe – Italy and Greece. The EU’s opposition to the South Stream was strong enough to block it in 2014. Any future expansion of the North Stream, despite Berlin’s clear interest in it, is meeting active resistance in Brussels, Warsaw and Washington.
With the end of the commodities super-cycle and the collapse of the oil price in 2014–16, the use of energy as an instrument of political pressure has become impractical. Moreover, the countries which feared such pressure – Poland, Lithuania, and now pro-Western Ukraine – have taken steps to minimize or even end their historic dependence on Russian direct energy supplies. In the case of Ukraine, this applies not only to purchases of Russian gas but also to electricity. As of 2016, Russia is delivering only coal to Kiev. The situation has reversed itself: the low oil price, which is hitting Russia very hard, has become a powerful factor in the Western strategy of “disciplining” Moscow. This invites a parallel to the mid-1980s, when the Saudi-engineered collapse of the oil price drove Gorbachev to the wall, turned the Soviet Union into a major debtor, and limited Moscow’s freedom of maneuver.
Cyber capabilities

Russia has other means of impacting on other countries and influencing their behavior. It has a powerful cyber warfare capacity, which it probably used against Estonia in 2007, Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2015. None of these cases, however, was decisive in the conflicts between Russia and the neighboring states. Georgia and Ukraine lost on the actual battlefield, not the virtual one, and Estonia did not change its policies on moving Soviet monuments and war graves away from Tallinn’s city center. Moreover, Tallinn has since become a NATO center for countering cyber warfare operations.
In a cyber war, Russia would certainly be a formidable foe. Its capabilities in the field add to its nuclear arsenal as an effective deterrent to the United States. International agreements on cyber security, a twenty-first-century equivalent of twentieth-century nuclear arms control, are many years away. While the area remains much more impervious to outside observers than nuclear weapons and missile technology, there are good reasons to believe that the United States and its allies are at least as advanced there as are Russia and China. And they too use cyber weapons when they see a need for it – as against Iran.
Portraying the United States and NATO as a threat to Russia
When on New Year’s Eve 2016 Russia adopted its new national security strategy, most Western commentators highlighted the portions of the document which referred to the United States and NATO actions as a threat to Russia. The document itself, however, hardly breaks new ground. Rather, it sums up the changes which have occurred since the beginning of the Ukraine crisis in 2014. Moscow does see the enhancement of NATO’s military infrastructure in the Baltic States and Poland, the US and other foreign military deployments in Eastern Europe and the adjacent waters and airspace, and US missile defenses in Poland and Romania as posing a military threat to Russia, and it will respond in kind.
Many observers point out that Moscow’s “declaration of a threat from the West” is largely beamed at the domestic audience. It may be annoying to many Europeans and Americans that the Kremlin is now using Russian–Western confrontation as a source of domestic

support. In the recent era of Russian–Western cooperation, however, there were similar complaints in the United States and Europe that the Kremlin was using good relations with the West to legitimize its rule. That the Kremlin can thrive politically on both good and bad relations with the West says something about the Russian political system, Russian society and the Kremlin’s ability to manage it, but hatred of the West is clearly not an obsession with the Russian leadership, which remains essentially pragmatic.
A bigger issue is Russia’s self-isolation as a result of the deepening estrangement from the rest of Europe and the West. This is happening not only as a result of Russian-imposed counter-boycotts, such as the food embargo against the EU, and the multiplying elements of xenophobia in the public domain, but also on account of the new penury which makes Russians buy fewer foreign goods, cut back on foreign travel, and keep their children in the country. The notion of the West “ganging up” on Russia has undercut the empathy toward Europe which prevailed not only in the two decades after the end of the Cold War but had existed even in the Soviet period. The already wide gulf between Russia and Europe keeps growing.
Russian political threat to Europe
When Russia was rich, money was considered its prime political weapon. Moscow, it was often claimed, could exploit the interests of various business circles, above all in Europe, in the Russian market, to the Russians’ advantage. Surprisingly for Moscow, these groups chose not to protest too loudly against the sanctions imposed on Russia in 2014 and have accepted significant losses as a result. However, they may not have given up entirely on the potential profits of Russian trade and economic cooperation. Some have left, while others have managed to adapt to the sanctions regime. Most are looking forward to the day when the sanctions are eased or lifted.
Sanctions, however, are not Russia’s worst problem. After growth ground to a halt in 2013, Russia has been in a deep economic recession. When and if Russia comes up with a new economic model of development to replace the now inoperable one based on a high and rising price for oil, European and other Western investors will start paying attention again. This is likely to be a long wait, at best.

Meantime, money, which used to be called Russia’s main tool for getting ahead with “greedy Westerners,” has become scarce. Like the energy weapon, the money weapon is now in other hands. It is the United States that decides how much of Russia it wants in the global money market.
Quite apart from the money magnet, there are also political groups within the European Union who occasionally side with Moscow on various issues. These range from the unease about US dominance (felt, e.g., within the German Die Linke party or among a few of France’s surviving true Gaullists), to US spying on its allies (even among Chancellor Merkel’s CDU associates), to anti-Brussels nationalism (as among Marine Le Pen’s voters in France or Viktor Orbán’s supporters in Hungary). Most of these forces are either left or right of center, which makes it difficult for Moscow to build ideological alliances with them. Some European nationalists, such as the Polish PiS party, are vehemently hostile to Moscow. The Kremlin’s pragmatism is good for tactical connections but prevents long-term cooperation. As for the European political mainstream, it is largely skeptical or inimical to Russia’s policies.
Even where there is a certain amount of popular support for friendly relations with Russia, the political elite remains largely Westernoriented. In Moldova, with its mercurial and notoriously corrupt politics, even the Communist Party headed by a former Russian police general is pro-EU. Serbia, for all its occasional Russophile rhetoric, is on track toward long-term integration into the European Union. Montenegro is soon to be admitted to NATO. Bulgarian elites are historically anti-Russian, having joined with Germany against Russia in both world wars. Greece, like Hungary, is using Russian connections as a bargaining chip in their relations with the EU. Cyprus used to profit hugely from Russian money on the island, but it obeyed the eurozone demands which hit Russian depositors very hard.
Russia is usually accused of implementing divideand-rule policies toward the European Union. It is indeed difficult not to engage in this practice, given the absence of a common foreign policy in the EU. The twenty-eight member states of the EU have differing interests, experiences and views of Russia. There are the former

Soviet republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940; there is Poland, divided several times by Russia and Germany; but there is also France, with strong historical and cultural ties; Austria, with strong business connections; and Germany, with its rich and twisted history of relations with Russia, which remarkably reached the point of historical reconciliation that permitted the country’s reunification in 1990.
Any outside power – be that the United States or China – dealing with a Europe which is more than a common market but less than a federation would be seeking the best ways to promote its interests through individual influential members of the Union besides going to Brussels. Russia, with its centuries-long history of relations with all European countries, has been doing this naturally. To the Russians, Europe is still mainly Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain, plus two dozen middle- and small-sized countries. However, any advances that the Russians have been able to make in relations with one member can be checked and reversed by other members less friendly toward Moscow. With the accession of Central and Eastern European states to the EU, the skeptics have won a de facto veto on ties with Russia that are too close. After Berlin toughened its stance toward Moscow, the Union’s most powerful country also joined the ranks of the skeptics. So much for the argument about Russian-fed Trojan horses inside the EU.
Shrinking spheres of influence
For all the talk of Russia’s bullying its neighbors, which is not without foundation, what is most striking is how little influence Moscow actually wields beyond its borders, even in the former USSR. Russia’s “sphere of influence” is actually limited to the territories it physically sustains and protects: Abkhazia; Donetsk and Lugansk; South Ossetia; and Transnistria. Even Moscow-allied Belarus often acts rather independently from Russia. Minsk still recognizes Georgia and Ukraine in their 1991 borders and keeps active relations with both Tbilisi and Kiev; it has become a prime re-exporter of the EU foodstuffs that Moscow banned from crossing into Russia, and President Alexander Lukashenko is adamant that Belarus remains a sovereign country, independent from Russia. Kazakhstan is even

more explicit in following its “multi-vector” foreign policy. Its president, Nursultan Nazarbaev, was offended by Vladimir Putin’s suggestions of Kazakhstan’s statehood being only a “recent” phenomenon and was reportedly “unnerved” by the Russian Navy’s October 2015 cruise missile strikes at Syria from the Caspian. The Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organization, which also includes Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, is remarkable for the lack of solidarity among its members with its de facto leader, Russia.
In the quarter-century since the Soviet Union’s disintegration, Russia has been dealing with the ruling elites in the newly independent states, usually seeking trade-offs with them, often subsidizing them, and – until very recently – ignoring their domestic opposition. For two decades it was prepared to stick to the 1991 borders and abandoned that stance only when the Kremlin saw a threat of NATO closing in, first in Georgia and then in Ukraine. So far, Russia has been reacting to revolutions and coups in the neighborhood rather than plotting and staging them. In Eastern Europe, Russia has finally “lost” Ukraine and Moldova; it has had to accept the massive growth of China’s economic and political influence in Central Asia and that of America (in Georgia) and Turkey (in Azerbaijan) in the South Caucasus. In the future, Russia’s sphere of influence is more likely to shrink further than to expand. The Russian Empire is definitely not making a comeback.
Use of ethnic Russians abroad as a destabilizing “fifth column”
For about a decade and a half after the break-up of the Soviet Union, defending the rights of compatriots abroad – i.e., some 25 million Russians who were left behind in the newly independent states when the Russian state receded to its current borders – was a fringe activity perpetrated by Russian nationalists, often in opposition to the Kremlin. It was only in 2008 that President Dmitri Medvedev, in the wake of the Georgia war, fought ostensibly to protect South Ossetians against Georgian “genocide” and declared Russia’s right to defend and protect its co-ethnics, particularly in former Soviet territory, which was termed a “zone of privileged interests” of the Russian Federation.

In 2008, this essentially applied to the Ossetians, whom Georgian President Saakashvili tried to bring back, alongside their selfdeclared republic, into Georgia. Six years later, this argument was used by President Putin to support the actions he had ordered in Crimea and with regard to Donbass. Putin talked about Russians as “the world’s biggest divided nation,” put forth the concept of Novorossiya (“New Russia,” a historical term for the northern Black Sea coast conquered by Russia from the Ottoman Empire in the late eighteenth century) for the Russian-speaking southern and eastern provinces of Ukraine, and discussed “the Russian world” as a habitat of Russophones and those who associate themselves with Russian culture and the Russian state.
This provoked Putin’s critics to draw comparisons with Hitler’s policies of bringing all Germans under one roof and the use of German minorities to undermine neighboring countries before their annexation or subjugation. Not only Latvia and Estonia, with their proportionally large contingents of ethnic Russians, many of them still – twenty-five years after independence – without the citizenship of their countries of origin, but also Russia’s own allies, such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, became worried. It took some time for the neighboring countries to see that the analogy with Hitler was wrong: the Kremlin had no plans to stoke ethnic tensions in order to destabilize and then annex former Soviet lands.
Agents of influence in the West
In the days of the abundance of financial resources, Russian money was considered to be a major tool in the hands of the Kremlin to buy influence in the West, not only “wholesale” but in a retail mode as well, recruiting “agents of influence.” In the most celebrated case, Gerhard Schroeder, soon after resigning as German chancellor in 2005, agreed to serve as chairman of the board of North Stream, Gazprom’s pipeline to Germany. A number of other senior Western businessmen, retired politicians and the like were offered positions in Russian companies, including some that were state-owned. Many accepted. A Washington K Street public relations company, Ketchum, was tasked with improving Russia’s public image in the West.

Certainly, Russians then were looking for partners and imagemakers in Europe and America to help them move around and integrate into the wider West which they aspired to join. They were doing what others – Asians, Middle Easterners, and the like – were doing before them. They were probably doing less than those others. And, clearly, Russian penetration of Western societies was no match for Western penetration of the Russian government in the early to mid-1990s, when US and European advisers acted at times as decision-makers in Russian ministries. Yet, this is definitely passé. In the current climate in Europe and the United States, being linked to Russian interests is a kiss of death for anyone with a public career in mind. Russia is now more appealing to retired actors and sports figures.
Russian spying in the West was an issue during the Cold War. Then there was a brief period, in the early 1990s, when a premium was laid on cooperation on issues of common concern, such as nonproliferation, terrorism and transnational crime. In a sincere and unique but obviously foolish step, the Russians in 1991 even gave the Americans plans of their listening devices in the US embassy in Moscow. CIA officials, such as Robert Gates, were fêted in Moscow as colleagues and nearly comrades-in-arms. In 2001, Putin ordered the General Staff to give full intelligence support to the US operation in Afghanistan. The return of adversity in Russia–NATO relations saw, predictably, a fresh expansion of traditional and new (cyber, etc.) intelligence activities. Still, what struck the Europeans in recent years more than reports of Russian intelligence becoming more active were the revelations of friendly spying on them and their leaders by their senior ally, the United States.
Russian authoritarianism and kleptocracy
For the Western liberal establishment, the very nature of the Russian political and economic system is a threat. In the Western mind, Russia has long been associated with tsarist autocracy, then communist totalitarianism, and now authoritarian kleptocracy. Its successive political systems have been the very antithesis of the rule of law, political freedom and human rights. Now, it is clearly authoritarian, despite the formal trappings of democracy. Its political

economy is bureaucratic capitalism, which lives off natural resources and favors those closest to the center of power. Property rights are conditional, and the legal system is managed by the powers that be. Civil society is under pressure.
The present primacy of the raison d’état – when corporate interests have been satisfied – rests on the memories, ideas and ideals taken from the past. Today’s Russia is frankly statist, patriotic/nationalistic and revisionist. Having lost the state in the botched attempt at reform under Gorbachev, the Kremlin is now focused on upholding its own supremacy. Having lost their empire, Russians are now in the process of building a multi-ethnic nation-state which puts a premium on nationalism. And, having been unable and unwilling to adapt to the US-dominated post-Cold War world, Russia is out to rebel against it, breaking the written and unwritten rules of behavior as it seeks to obtain recognition for its great-power status.
The Byzantine system of governance still prevailing in Russia makes the Kremlin decision-making process opaque, while the concentration and centralization of power in the hands of the sole individual at the top provides for policy steps which can be both sudden and surprising to outsiders. Whereas, in the US system, taking a decision on the use of force can take a lot of time and require a major effort at the inter-agency level, as well as between the White House and Congress, in the Russian system, one man essentially decides all. As a result, Russia can move very quickly, and by stealth, surprising even seasoned outside observers – as in Crimea, Donbass and Syria.

Russia: apart from Europe rather than a part of Europe
Many in the West traditionally view Russia as a country apart from Europe, the classical “Other.” The 1990s Western debate on the “borders of Europe,” which accompanied the NATO/EU enlargement process, revealed strongly held convictions – though by no means universal – that Russia was, indeed, an outsider, which could at best be a partner of Europe, not part of it. In the late 2000s and 2010s, the center of gravity shifted to the view of Russia as an authoritarian alternative to the European values, norms and principles. Initially, the view of a “Russian model” was supported by the country’s rapid oil-fired economic growth. When the growth stalled and was followed by recession, Russia came to be portrayed as a country that bullies its neighbors and corrupts everyone around.
Indeed, the Kremlin has a different approach than the EU governments to a number of important issues: state sovereignty, the use of military force, and the world order. Angela Merkel was right to say in 2014 that Vladimir Putin lives in a different world. This is a realist’s world. Whereas the countries of Europe, and Germany above all, have largely transcended their troubled history, Russia is still going through it. But, truth be told, wherever Russia may be, it keeps company there with much of the rest of the world. The EU is a happy exception: not even the United States, with its distinct view of America’s exceptionalism, sovereignty, military power and world order – one “American century” succeeding another – is where Europe is on these issues.
To strengthen the case of Russia’s un-European nature, adherents of that view pointed to official Russian concepts of the country as a separate Eurasian civilization, facing both the East and the West. These concepts, of course, have deep roots in Russian history – and this is another issue of concern to the West.
Treatment of history
Post-Soviet Russia’s unwillingness to do to the Soviet Union’s legacy what West Germans had done to that of the Third Reich is disturbing to quite a few people in Europe. In Russia, the Communist Party was

not put on trial, nor were its members limited in their political rights. The Soviet Union itself is viewed as a historical form of the Russian state, a seventy-year period in Russia’s millennium of history, a legitimate polity rather than a criminal aberration – even though officially the Romanov dynasty is revered and the Bolshevik revolution is rejected. In this scheme of things, Stalin, the World War II commander-in-chief and builder of the Soviet state, is a more respectable figure, despite his well-known crimes, than Lenin, who destroyed the Russian imperial state and worked for Russia’s defeat in World War I.
This reading of history jars with the views of those in Eastern and Central Europe who see their countries primarily as victims of both the Soviet Union and, before it, the Russian Empire. What is most sacred in the Russian history textbook – the Soviet victory in World War II – appears to many in Europe’s east as a replacement of Nazi rule by Soviet totalitarianism. In Estonia and Latvia, those who served with the Wehrmacht and even the German SS between 1941 and 1945 are recognized as national heroes, while those who fought on the side of the Red Army are termed occupiers. Present-day Ukraine puts Soviet World War II veterans and the nationalists who fought against them, also in alliance with the Nazis, on an equal footing. While Russia and Poland made a productive effort in the late 2000s and the early 2010s to discuss the dark issues of their common history, there is unlikely to be much agreement between the Russians, on the one hand, and the Baltic countries, on the other.
In the victims’ optic, Russia is equated with communism and its most brutal practices. The famine which in 1932–3 hit large parts of the Soviet Union, including Ukraine, southern and central Russia, and Kazakhstan, is officially characterized by Kiev as genocide of the Ukrainian people by Moscow. The fact that Stalin, six decades after his death, is still viewed by a large portion of the Russian population as a great leader is presented as testimony to the evergreen penchant of the Russian people for a strong hand, even an exceedingly cruel one. That, for a lot of ordinary Russian people today Stalin is, however unlikely, a protest symbol against rampant corruption, is usually overlooked.
***

The fears described above are based on facts and have long roots in history. Russia is authoritarian and has a distinct view of itself as a great power. To the Europeans, Russia, a near neighbor sharing the continent with them but politically and ideologically alien, denies them the promise of a “Europe whole and free,” a “europäische Friedensordnung.” It also evokes the bitter memories of the past century and suggests frightening parallels.
These memories and parallels, however, paint a picture which does not exist now and has no chance of emerging in the future. Russia has no resources and no real will to re-create its Eurasian empire, all the more so because the would-be parts of that empire would resist being included in it; it has no ambition to conquer neighboring EU/NATO member states, thus risking a war with the US; its brand of authoritarianism is a domestic, not an export product; its statedominated economic system is not a model for others to emulate; its ideology is nationalistic, not international; and its capacity to infiltrate Western societies is very modest.
If anything, the West should fear Russia’s weakness more than its strength. A quarter-century after the Soviet implosion, the country is very brittle. It is now going through a major economic crisis, which has structural roots; the modicum of political stability which exists depends essentially on the popularity of Vladimir Putin, thus hanging by a thread; and the absence of durable institutions within the present system and of a credible alternative to the current regime suggest that a serious political crisis, when it happens, might lead to chaos. Russia also gives precious little advance warning before it stirs; and, after it begins to stir, it soon starts to shake.
There is little that the outside world can do to affect the Russian internal political dynamic; the West needs, however, to see clearly the real challenge which Russia poses and find a constructive way of dealing with it.

2 The Russia Challenge
US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter has put Russia at the top of the list of security challenges and threats to the United States, ahead of China, Iran, North Korea and ISIL.10 So, what is Russia’s challenge to the West?
What does Russia want?
Vladimir Putin’s long leadership is essentially about two things: first, to keep Russia in one piece and, second, to return it to the ranks of the world’s great powers. By the mid-2010s the first mission looked accomplished, with the country not merely united under the imperial presidency but with the president’s personal popularity – or public acquiescence in him – standing at well above 80 percent. As for the second, in the Ukraine conflict Russia shook off the constraints imposed on it by the post-Cold War system; and, through its direct military intervention and parallel diplomatic activity in Syria, Russia has suddenly become indispensable in the issues of war and peace in one of the world’s most turbulent regions – the Middle East. If there is a strategy behind the Kremlin’s actions, here is its main objective.
In the past decade and a half, Russia’s self-image has changed considerably. Putin and his entourage still view the country as European in origin, a successor to the Eastern Christian Byzantine tradition, but they see it primarily as fully sovereign – on a par with the rest of Europe, rather than an associate of the EU. A continentsize country, uniting Slavic, Turkic and scores of other ethnic elements, a home to four religions legally deemed indigenous – Orthodox Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Buddhism – Russia appears to these individuals a distinct geopolitical, economic and cultural unit, a potential center of attraction for neighbors in Eurasia, and a partner to those in the non-West advocating a multipolar world order.

In geopolitical and geostrategic terms, the Kremlin posits Russia as a great power with a global reach. It rejects as ludicrous or malicious any attempts to put Russia into a category of regional powers. Geography is the Kremlin’s major asset: a country which borders directly on Norway and North Korea – as well as on America, China and Japan – and whose reach extends from the icy Arctic to the approaches to the Middle East and Afghanistan, cannot easily be boxed in. Russia’s modest economic and demographic weight, the Kremlin argues, does not tell the whole story: the country has immense potential for growth and its demographics are improving. What is more important is the fact that Russia, alongside the United States and China, is at the moment one of the world’s only three major independent military powers.
Russian official views on the global order traditionally favor greatpower concert as the best means of managing the international system. Russia’s Alexander I was one of the key players at the Vienna Congress of 1815, which ushered in the Concert of Europe and the Holy Alliance; thereafter, he and his successor Nicholas I were the dominant figures in Central and Eastern Europe. Joseph Stalin, in the company of US presidents and UK prime ministers at Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam in 1943–5, laid the foundation of the post-World War II global order, which divided Europe and the world. On the other hand, Mikhail Gorbachev tried but utterly failed to keep the Soviet Union intact and in play as a power center in the post-Cold War world, and Boris Yeltsin nearly accepted US leadership. Hence, Putin’s mission to restore Russia’s rightful place on the global scene.
Such elevation, however, cannot be achieved with the post-Cold War global order intact. The place Russia is seeking is that of a codecision-maker, a country that co-writes the rules, watches over their application, and implements sanctions as necessary. Moscow’s ideal is the pentarchy of the United Nations Security Council as a global concert, with Russia as its permanent, veto-wielding member. In fact, the implications of Russia’s international “restoration” include checking US supremacy by subjecting the US itself to the authority of the UNSC. Russians can accept US pre-eminence, but not dominance.

Russia’s ambitions, however, are not always backed up by the realities of power. Throughout its history, it has had to press hard, and often fight, in order to be recognized. It has learned to compensate for its deficiencies in military power, economic development and cultural standard. To succeed, it relied on quantity to offset quality, resorted to centralization and mobilization, displayed the temerity of punching way above its weight, demonstrated boldness and swiftness of action, and leaned on its time-tested capacity to pay a very high price to achieve its important goals.
After a period of good luck at the beginning of the twenty-first century in the form of ever rising oil prices, Russia was hit by their collapse, compounded by the structural problems of its own economy, the corrupt and stifling politico-economic system, and, on top of it all, the sanctions imposed upon Russia as a result of the Ukraine crisis. These are all massive challenges which put in question the capacity of the current ruling elite to hold the country together and lead it onto a path of economic development. A failure to respond adequately to those challenges will have dire consequences for the sustainability of the entire system and the stability of the country itself.
Challenges to the United States
It is truly an irony of history that the United States should be overtly challenged by a party such as today’s Russia – a country whose GDP is a small fraction of America’s, whose share in the global trade is a mere 1 percent, and even whose defense budget is a tenth of the Pentagon’s. To most educated Americans, Russia is the day before yesterday’s news, a country on the long and irreversible trajectory of decline. It is a third- or fourth-tier actor in a remote corner of the globe, with a contemptible leadership mired in corruption, which can be a nuisance at best.
Figures of comparison, however, do not tell the whole story. Among the countries of the world, Russia has a unique quality: its ruling elite and its people strongly reject domination of the international system by any one power. And Russians are ready to push back when they see their own interests in danger, despite the long odds. Unlike

the Chinese, the Russians are anything but incremental in their approach to world hegemons: they are bona fide in-your-face people.
In 2014, the Russians may have jumped the gun, and faced the consequences, but Russia’s rebellion against the post-Cold War order does not run against the current global trend. If anything, the Russians have found themselves ahead of the curve, but not too much. The quarter-century period of amicable relations among all the major powers, guaranteed by US near-hegemony in the system, a sort of Pax Americana, is over. China and India, Iran and Saudi Arabia, are becoming increasingly active in their respective neighborhoods. Major power relations are again becoming an issue, and their movements will reshape the global order.
Eastern Europe
In Eastern Europe, the United States has had to live since 2014 with a status quo which it does not accept. Washington has failed to make its rules stick and walked back from the assurances of Ukraine’s territorial integrity contained in the 1994 Budapest memorandum, which the United States signed alongside Britain and Russia. Few people in the world believe that Russia will hand Crimea back to Ukraine. Donbass remains an issue, where Moscow keeps insisting on a compromise political solution which Kiev resists. The result is another frozen conflict. The United States has no leverage to make Russia back down under pressure. Even though overall US power clearly dwarfs that of Russia, the stakes for Moscow in Ukraine are so much higher than Washington’s, and the Kremlin is prepared to go to much greater lengths. If push comes to shove, Americans would hardly send their sons and daughters to defend Ukraine. As a result, the “balance of will” in the former Soviet Union is not in America’s favor.
In response to the Russian challenge, the United States has been able to consolidate allies and reinvent NATO for the mission for which it had been originally designed. However, what one is witnessing is not exactly the Cold War revisited. Most Americans do not see Russia as a threat. Thus, a new commitment to the defense of Europe is, to many, an unnecessary distraction from more important issues, such as the fight against ISIL. Sensing this, America’s new allies in

Eastern and Central Europe fear that the United States will leave them in the lurch and deal with Russia behind their backs. The Baltic States and even Poland are worried that Russia will attack and occupy them, with the United States unable to protect their allies and unwilling to risk a nuclear exchange with Russia for the sake of Eastern Europeans.
As a result, the demand for a US presence on the ground in Europe’s east will be greater, but so will be the risks for the United States itself, in a situation which few Americans will find existential. The downing by Turkey, a NATO member, of a Russian warplane in Syria in 2015 is a case in point. An incident like this could have been much more dangerous over the Baltic or the Black Sea. For the time being, the United States has decided to rotate a brigade-size force in Eastern Europe to create a quasi-permanent military presence in the area, but this may anger the Russians more than reassure the Balts and the Poles.
The Middle East
In the Middle East, Russia reinserted itself into the region dominated for a quarter-century solely by the US. In doing this, Moscow broke the informal American monopoly on the legitimate use of force – and, so far, has got away with it. At minimum, Russia’s intervention carried the risk of inadvertent collision between US and Russian aircraft, but it also opened the possibility in Syria of a US– Russian war by proxy. Even when those risks were initially managed, Russia’s proactive diplomacy exploited the effect of its military engagement and returned Moscow as a player in the Middle East, hardly a welcome development for the United States. As already noted, this brought the Kremlin closer to its goal of reclaiming greatpower status beyond the former Soviet space.
As the United States chose to work with Russia to produce a political settlement in Syria, it effectively played along with Moscow’s ambitions. Ever since John Kerry’s first visit as secretary of state to the Kremlin in May 2013, Vladimir Putin was suggesting something like a Dayton-à-deux solution in Syria, with Moscow and Washington as its two co-sponsors. At that point, this was unacceptable to the United States. Putin, however, deftly used Barack Obama’s

reluctance to bomb Damascus after the chemical attack to offer a plan of Syria’s chemical disarmament as an alternative to US military strikes. Despite many doubts, the plan worked, with the US and Russia leading an international effort that, amid the civil war there, rid Syria of chemical weapons.
In 2015, the Russian military intervention, coupled with Europe’s influx of a million migrants, many from Syria, pushed the United States to probe the Russian Dayton formula. The Vienna/Geneva process has been exceedingly difficult, partly because even a US– Russian accord does not guarantee success without the endorsement of regional players, above all Iran and Saudi Arabia. Yet, even without the agreement, the very image of Russia and the United States presiding over the newest peace process in the Middle East helps to confer on Russia the status it covets. Such duopoly creates uncertainty among some of Washington’s allies and partners that the US is dealing with Russia over their heads.
Greater Eurasia
While the “little Eurasia” of the former Soviet republics is unlikely to coalesce in the form of a new USSR or the historical Russian Empire, a Greater Eurasia is emerging, driven by China’s march westward and Russia’s coincidental turn to the east. Gone are the days at the turn of the century when the United States could claim to be the dominant power in Eurasia. For the first time since the empire of Genghis Khan, the great continent of Eurasia – from the Western Pacific to the Eastern Atlantic – is being integrated thanks to the dynamics coming primarily from Asia. This has the potential of changing all of Eurasia beyond recognition.
The Russian–Chinese rapprochement and Beijing’s and Moscow’s reciprocal westward and eastward turns predate the Ukraine crisis, but both were given a boost by the breakdown of Russia’s relations with the West. True, there has been and will be no “geopolitical merger” as a result. An alliance between China and Russia looks unlikely, but the present bilateral relationship is much more than the “strategic partnership” it is formally dubbed. It is certainly more than a marriage of convenience. For lack of a better word, the state of relations can be described as an entente. This denotes a degree of

mutual empathy and geopolitical convergence based on overlapping worldviews and a joint resentment of US global dominance.
Most Americans are relaxed about the prospects of China and Russia drawing closer together. Any alliance between Beijing and Moscow, their logic goes, would have China on top. Russia, however, will not enjoy being a junior partner to China and will seek to break away from its tight embrace. In such a scenario, only one credible option will remain open to Moscow: seek reconciliation with Washington and some form of association with the European Union. This would mean Russia’s geopolitical surrender.
This reasoning is not flawless. The situation in Eurasia can change to the disadvantage of the United States. For all their reported contempt for the Russians, the Chinese have been very considerate and careful when dealing with their northern neighbors. Since the normalization of their relations with Moscow in 1989, they have been able to achieve so much more with Russia than the West, while evoking practically no pushback from the Russians. The Chinese appreciate the value of appearances and do not humiliate the Russians publicly, whatever they might think of them in private. Beijing’s centralized control not only over policy but also over public discussion of policy protects the relationship from unnecessary provocations.
Each country is wary of coming too close to the other. China and Russia, however, can continue to consolidate and upgrade their relationship short of an alliance. In this case, more of Russia’s natural and military-technological resources would be made available to China. Strategic coordination between Moscow and Beijing would remain loose, but, in the larger scheme of things concerning the world order, Beijing and Moscow will be on the same side. The Greater Eurasia that they are constructing will not be run from a single center, but their continental entente will essentially be aimed at limiting US dominance on the edges of the continent and in the world at large.
Strategic stability and arms issues
Despite the Pentagon’s towering position in the global military field, the latter offers some advantages to Moscow. Russia remains a

nuclear superpower, in an exclusive league with the United States. The nuclear deterrent is back in play in US–Russian relations, countering President Obama’s grand vision of a world less reliant on nuclear weapons. While nuclear is back, arms control is frozen and may even be on the way out. There is virtually no prospect in the foreseeable future of new US–Russian strategic arms reduction agreements. The advent of strategic non-nuclear systems and strategic defenses complicates the task of any future negotiators. The arrival of China as a major military power makes bilateral US– Russian arms control increasingly insufficient and obsolete, while any trilateral deals are technically exceedingly complex and, for the time being, politically impossible.
Outside of the nuclear field, Russia’s military, of course, is not the Pentagon’s peer. Yet, it is re-emerging as a capable force which can make a difference in a number of theaters, from the Middle East to Central Asia to the Arctic. With post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe now history, there are dangers of uncontrolled military activity along the new line of Russia–NATO confrontation in Eastern Europe. Incidents in the air and at sea, provocative war games scenarios, and troops and weapons deployments create a vast potential for miscalculation in an area which has been considered safe for twenty-five years.
Russia remains a top global exporter of arms and military technology, second only to the United States. Even in the times of current crisis, the defense industry is prioritized by the Kremlin: the requirements of confrontation are compelling, plus it is being viewed as a locomotive for Russia’s new industrialization. Russian arms deliveries to various countries, such as China, India or Iran, can and do affect local and regional balances. Russia is also well equipped in cyber warfare capabilities. These assets carry a major potential risk to the United States. At the other end of the spectrum, Russia has shown a capacity for waging “hybrid warfare,” operating just under the threshold of conventional military operations.
Geo-economics
Russia has been the largest economy put under sanctions in recent times. In geo-economic terms, the US-orchestrated sanctions against

Russia have exacerbated the process of global economic fragmentation. Russia has responded to the Western restrictions by imposing a food imports ban on the sanctioning countries, primarily members of the European Union. Traditionally strong economic relations between Russia and Ukraine have been broken. Following the spat with Ankara, Moscow initiated sanctions of its own against Turkey, until recently a major economic partner. Other countries, such as China, watching the Russian–Western economic wars are making conclusions for themselves about the ability of economic ties to provide stability to political relations. The global economic system that had been experiencing increasing strain for some time thus received a powerful blow.
Challenges to the European Union
The European Union was directly challenged by Moscow’s response to its support for Ukraine’s pro-Western orientation. The EU failed to appreciate the geopolitical, economic and even psychological importance of Ukraine to the Russian leadership and people and pursued its Eastern Partnership project without much thinking about its wider implications. At the crucial moment, as Ukraine’s fate was being decided, European diplomacy failed to manage a soft landing for the Yanukovych regime and the ensuing power transfer, and thus the EU was exposed as an irrelevant and – in the Kremlin’s view – an untrustworthy actor.
The Ukraine crisis that soon followed brought home to the European leaders, starting with Angela Merkel, both the harsh reality of war on the EU’s very doorstep and the possibility of an even wider conflagration affecting members of the Union itself. This caught the EU off guard: it had not been equipped to deal with geopolitical crises. This was the responsibility of NATO – i.e., the US. On the other hand, bailing out Ukraine and helping it reform itself is a mighty challenge – one which falls mainly on the European Union.
Russia meanwhile has become even more divisive for the unity of the EU and for transatlantic relations. In the wake of the downing of the Malaysian airliner over Donbass in 2014, German and other European business circles, which had traditionally seen Russia as a major opportunity, acquiesced in their governments putting politics

– or, some would say, principles – before profits. At the time, this was a remarkable achievement by Europe’s politicians, given the volume of trade between the EU and Russia – about €1 billion a day in 2013. Since then, the volume of trade has halved.
However, this common stance on Russia is difficult to sustain over the long term. Different European countries have very different experiences with Russia, and very different expectations. Whereas the Baltic States and Poland are deeply worried about their former hegemon, and Sweden and Britain remain traditionally skeptical of the historical rival, France, Germany, Italy and Austria do not feel threatened and want to continue trading with Russia without constraints, while Greece and Cyprus are basically friendly. There is potential for individual countries opting out of the sanctions regime which, given the EU requirement of unanimity of decision-making on the issue, would terminate it.
So far, the Europeans have managed to stick together on Russia sanctions and to form a common front with the United States. It has been one of the major foreign policy accomplishments of the Obama administration that EU and US sanctions are essentially identical and offer no daylight to the Kremlin. Given the very light US exposure – in contrast to that of Europe – to Russian trade, US sanctions are expected to stay indefinitely, as there is no domestic constituency for removing them. If, however, the price of the EU keeping its sanctions on Russia becomes too great at some point, this would open a gap between Europeans and Americans that Moscow would welcome.
It is not only material issues that present the Europeans with challenges related to Russia. The Kremlin has adopted an ideology of conservatism or traditionalism and designated liberalism as an opponent. This, of course, does not prevent Moscow from being opportunistic when circumstances allow or demand it. Russian conservatism on such issues as the value of national sovereignty, the role of religion in society, or the importance and nature of the family, however, finds an echo in those quarters across Europe which are disillusioned with globalization and the European project. A more successful Russia and smarter Russian policy could in the future capitalize more in these areas.

Until the Ukraine crisis, Russia was pushing for some form of EuroRussian confederacy, under the rubric of a “Greater Europe,” from Lisbon to Vladivostok. This would have been based on a marriage between Russian resources and European industry, cemented by asset swaps, cross-investments and technology transfers, and various sorts of exchanges among people. Such a Europe would certainly have been whole, and might even – depending on the level of EU– Russian policy coordination – have played a global role, but at the price of distancing itself from the United States. Many Europeans with strong Atlanticist convictions were wary of the idea, which would have not so much tied Russia to the EU as the other way around. When Vladimir Putin laid out his plans to the German political and business communities in 2010, he got a cool reception from Angela Merkel.
Meanwhile, the challenge of Russia as “Greater Europe’s” potentially dominant power has been succeeded by a different kind of challenge. Russia’s alienation from Europe has coincided with its turn to the east, all the way to the Pacific. In 2012, the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia was upgraded to become a Eurasian Economic Union. The “Greater Europe” concept was thus transformed into a binary construct composed of the EU and the EEU. In 2015, Moscow agreed to “harmonize” the EEU with Beijing’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative. The result could be a “Greater Eurasia” from Shanghai to St Petersburg. Long the east of the West, Russia could turn into the west of the East.
The ultimate challenge for the Europeans, of course, would be a Russia that breaks down and threatens to disintegrate. Should this happen – and this cannot be completely ruled out – it would create a major source of instability on Europe’s eastern fringes. The much referred to “collapse” of the Soviet Union was in fact a more or less orderly dismantlement of its huge edifice. Of all exits from an empire, Russia’s in the 1990s was one of the least bloody and most cheerful: Moscow itself was leading the process. There is no certainty, however, that a new “geopolitical catastrophe,” should it occur, would be as mild. With all these issues at the back of one’s mind, how has the West dealt recently with the Russian challenge?

3 Bringing Russia into Line
For a number of years, the Russian challenge, in gestation, was largely ignored. Russia was expected by some to bite the bullet and adapt or adjust to the new world-order realities. Others expected it to transform itself – e.g., from Saul to Paul. In any event, Russia was perceived as too weak to matter much; as sufficiently integrated into the global economy, on the one hand, and highly vulnerable because of its dependence on the oil price, on the other; and too corrupt to take on the West, for fear of having their hidden riches or dubious transactions exposed and risking court proceedings and even arrests. Essentially, this condition was expected to last a very long while.
The West as a whole did not have a Russia strategy: Russia simply was not an issue big enough to warrant that. The European Union, which on account of its geographical proximity had to pay more attention to Russia than the United States, became progressively disillusioned with the prospect of Russia’s “Europeanization.” The EU, however, does not operate as a strategic unit at all. As mentioned, the operators of the Eastern Partnership project grossly misjudged the stakes involved in Ukraine. When the Ukraine crisis broke out, the EU essentially withdrew to the background.
The United States has learned to look down on Russia, which was neither an issue nor a big enough partner. In Ukraine, the US, which had remained in the background during the Maidan stand-off, had to step forward when the Europeans proved unable to manage the crisis they had helped create. Washington soon forged a new NATO-wide approach to Russia which combined political isolation, economic pressure and information warfare, plus strengthening NATO and support for Ukraine itself. The policy’s stated objective was to make the Kremlin back off on Ukraine and step back in line. Europe basically went along with it.
Political isolation

The Ukraine crisis first resulted in largely symbolic measures. Russia was de facto expelled from the G8, which reverted to its more homogeneous G7 format. Cooperation in a number of other fora, from the NATO–Russia Council to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, was restricted or frozen. Top-level meetings and high-level contacts were reduced to the bare minimum. The aim was to demonstrate the West’s strong disapproval of Moscow’s policies and to send the message that there will not be business as usual until Moscow changes its behavior.
The result, after more than two years, has been the sealing of the chasm between the West and Russia. The relationship has taken a new, clearly adversarial quality. Mutual adversity is now the new normal. Political isolation, however, is little more than a phrase. There is nothing like an iron curtain physically separating Russia from the West, the way it was with the Soviet Union. Top-level visits became rare, but since the start of the Ukraine crisis President Putin has been to Austria, Australia, France, Hungary, Italy, Turkey and the United States, sometimes for multilateral summits. He has also toured key non-Western countries – Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Iran, and others – and received leaders of dozens of countries in Russia.
Other forms of communication were not broken off. Leaders’ phone calls, particularly between Putin and Obama, and between Putin and Merkel, have become, if anything, more frequent. In 2015 alone, the US secretary of state and the Russian foreign minister met about twenty times. The Normandy format brought together the Russian president and the leaders of Germany and France, as well as Ukraine, to discuss the Ukraine crisis. Despite his supposed “isolation,” Vladimir Putin held a number of informal but substantive meetings with Barack Obama.
True, there is no more warmth in these contacts, but they focus on issues that cannot be resolved without Russia – Ukraine, Iran and other non-proliferation concerns, and Syria. Russia, of course, remains a very active permanent member of the UN Security Council. It is also a member of the G20, and attempts to suspend it from the group were immediately rebuffed by China and other nonWestern states. Against the background of deteriorating relations

with the US and the EU, Russia’s ties with non-Western countries – including in such clubs as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), whose back-to-back summits Putin hosted in 2015 – have grown, even though they do not replace or compensate for the broken ties with the West. Russia, no longer an aspiring candidate for membership in an expanded West, is now positioning itself as part of the global non-West.
Within Russia, alienation from the West has had the effect of rallying the bulk of the population around the flag, the Kremlin and Putin. The Western insistence that isolationist measures are directed against Putin’s policies rather than the Russian people is not cutting much ice. Most Russians see Western attempts at isolating the Kremlin as a proof of the United States and its allies being Russia’s historical competitors, and the Kremlin, to them, becomes a symbol of national resistance. True, this image, spread by state-controlled television, is not shared by the 20 percent or so who remain committed to Russia’s European/Western vocation, but it rings many bells with the rest of the population. For the Kremlin, history is a very powerful ally. It is also joined by another highly improbably ally, economics.
Economic sanctions
Western disapproval of Russian policies in Ukraine did not remain symbolic for long. In July 2014 real punitive measures came. The aim of the “sectoral” sanctions, covering banking, high technology and other sectors of the economy, was to put pressure on members of Putin’s inner circle, who were known to have substantial assets in the West; pinch hard the oligarchs who were used to borrowing in the West to keep their empires going; target several branches of the Russian economy as a whole, particularly the defense industry and oil exploration, by denying high-technology transfers to them; place Crimea off limits to international business; and, eventually, bring home to ordinary Russians that the Kremlin policies which they supported en masse carried a cost that they now had to bear.
The immediate result of these steps was manifold. The inner circle clung even closer to Putin: the sanctions have become a loyalty test, which they were all determined to pass. They were duly rewarded for

their losses by new opportunities in Russia. For some, Western censure came as a badge of distinction which protected them from the president’s displeasure on other grounds. The oligarchs faced a choice between staying in Russia and moving out. Some chose the latter, but most stayed: rather than being the real owners of their holdings, they were actually managing them on the Kremlin’s behalf. The economy was offered the option of import substitution, including as a result of Russia banning food supplies from the sanctioning countries, and Crimea received an influx of federal transfers. As for the ordinary Sergeis and Natalias, they suddenly discovered that they were Russians.
Western sanctions, of course, had a major impact on the Russian economy. They added to the structural economic crisis that the country had entered in 2013. Stagnation turned into recession in the fall of 2014 as a result of the sharp drop in the price of oil, which continued to slide downward in 2015 and 2016. The lack of Western investment and technology transfers and the inability to raise finance in Western money markets are not the most serious elements of the current Russian economic recession, but they add to the severity of the crisis. This economic crunch remains the main hope of Western governments: that the Kremlin runs out of reserves to keep the country running and to maintain even the minimum support of the population, and so will have to start rolling back its policies.
This outcome will become evident only in several years’ time: for the present moment, Moscow has enough resources to stay the course, even if some expenses have been trimmed or pushed back. The crisis is forcing the Kremlin toward hard choices in its economic policy, essentially between a more liberal approach to unchain the energies of the national business community, on the one hand, and an effort to mobilize all available resources under strict government control, on the other. Neither option, however, promises a softening of Moscow’s policies toward the West: a replay of the 1980s situation which thrust Mikhail Gorbachev into the hands of the Soviet Union’s Western creditors, and constrained Moscow to make geopolitical concessions, is unlikely this time around. 2015 was a difficult year for the Russian companies which have had to repay Western loans, but as a result the country’s corporate debt has markedly decreased.

While they are not part of a formal response to Russian actions in Ukraine, the European Union’s steps to reduce dependence on Russian energy supplies have resulted in the forced abandonment of Gazprom’s South Stream project which would have supplied gas to Southern and South-Eastern Europe. An expansion of Gazprom’s other project, the North Stream, which connects Russia and Germany across the Baltic Sea, which Germany wants, is under pressure within the EU and from across the Atlantic. In conjunction with other measures, Gazprom’s share of the EU’s gas market has shrunk considerably. The energy relationship, the mainstay of EU– Russian trade, has frayed.
Support for eastern NATO countries
Next to putting pressure on Russia, supporting NATO allies on its borders has been a priority for Western leaders. In the wake of the Ukraine crisis, the three Baltic States – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – felt they might be the next targets of “Russian aggression” – a striking expression of their lack of confidence in the alliance which they had joined a decade before. Poland also felt exposed. NATO, at its September 2014 summit in Wales, essentially reclassified Russia as a problem rather than a partner and decided to build a rapid reaction force to deal with contingencies along its eastern frontier and to enhance the heretofore very light alliance presence in the eastern member states. Following that, some US heavy weapons were positioned in those countries, and NATO exercises were held there, sometimes virtually right across the border from Russia. As a next step, the United States will keep a rotating – and thus quasipermanent – troop presence in the eastern NATO countries.
There is no evidence to suggest that Russia harbored any designs on the former Baltic republics of the Soviet Union, not to mention the former Soviet satellite Poland. NATO steps, however, are designed to provide a degree of reassurance to the eastern allies that they will not be left one-on-one with Russia in the event of a crisis. This is reminiscent of the Cold War situation, when US boots on the ground, rather than a formal pledge under Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, were considered a credible guarantee – a “tripwire” – of defense in the hour of need. Even that, however, was not enough

then: remember the never-to-be-answered question of whether the United States would risk losing Chicago to defend Hamburg or West Berlin.
At the same time, expansion of NATO military infrastructure, not just the alliance’s “political” membership, toward the Russian border is leading to consolidation of a new permanent stand-off between NATO and Russia. The “Suwalki gap” – 70 kilometers or so of Polish and Lithuanian territory which separate Kaliningrad from Belarus which, if controlled by Russian forces, could cut off the Baltics from mainland NATO territory – is taking the place in NATO’s strategic minds of the famous Fulda gap on the former inner-German border. Add US missile defenses in Poland and Romania, and US Navy ships patrolling the Baltic and the Black Sea, and the message to Russia cannot be ignored.
The message, however, is inevitably read in Moscow not so much as a warning to keep off NATO territory as the United States and its allies demonstrating their capacity to apply military pressure on Russia, now from very close range. The Russian General Staff, which before the Ukraine crisis had regarded Russia’s western border as relatively safe, is consequently revising the armed forces’ posture, deployment pattern and military exercise scenarios. Kaliningrad, after all, is much bigger than West Berlin, and there are no constraints regarding the deployment there of powerful Russian weapons systems, including missiles. This, in turn, would only make the Baltic countries and Poland more nervous.
Supporting Ukraine and other non-NATO states
In 2014, Western countries gave immediate and full support to the leaders of the Euromaidan revolution that toppled the corrupt Yanukovych regime. Western support, however, was powerless to prevent the seizure of Crimea by Russian forces or the Russian intervention in Donbass. What NATO would have done in the event of a large-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, which might have been an option considered by the Kremlin in 2014, is a moot point. In actual fact, the United States and its allies supplied Ukraine with intelligence and non-lethal military equipment, but stopped short of

sending weapons which could have led to an escalation toward direct collision with Russia.
For the same reason, NATO membership for Ukraine is difficult to imagine while the conflict with Russia continues. Analogies with post-World War II Germany are far-fetched here, and, while they recognize Crimea as part of Ukraine, Western governments would not risk going to war with Russia over it. The United States, focused elsewhere, has de facto subcontracted daily management of the Ukraine crisis to Germany, flanked by France. The Minsk I and II agreements, which Berlin and Paris helped forge, resulted in a ceasefire in Donbass by the spring of 2015 and offered a tentative path to a political solution, but in reality they froze the conflict.
The terms of Minsk II, incidentally, are actually quite acceptable to Moscow but are anathema to Kiev. The agreement would result in Ukraine giving its regions, including Donbass, the power of veto over accession bids to alliances such as NATO and, moreover, would legitimize the anti-Maidan authorities in Donbass. No wonder that Kiev’s best option is to sabotage the accord’s implementation.
Ukraine’s association with the European Union – the issue which sparked off the revolution in Kiev – has been a reality since 2015. A deep free trade area between the EU and Ukraine is a fact, even if EU membership for the latter is at best a long way off. Trade between Ukraine and Russia has collapsed. Ukrainians are on track to visafree entry into the Schengen countries, while Kiev has banned all air travel with Russia. Post-Maidan Ukraine, while still ruled essentially by a corrupt oligarchy, is geopolitically westward-leaning, and the Ukrainian political nation is being built on a clear anti-Russian foundation. Russia may control Donbass for the time being, and may keep Crimea for good, but the bulk of Ukraine has become a ward of the West. Ukraine’s overall stability now depends not so much on defense from Russia as on Kiev’s ability to deal with the hard-hit economy and deep-seated corruption.
Georgia, two of whose former provinces, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, have been recognized by Russia as independent states – with Russian garrisons in place in both – has recently maintained a calm relationship with Russia, with low border tensions and a revival of trade. In 2014, the EU concluded an association agreement with

Georgia, and NATO reaffirmed its pledge to admit the country sometime in the future. Interestingly, in contrast to what happened in Ukraine, this did not evoke overly negative reactions from Moscow. To the Kremlin, the current pro-Western but predictable government in Tbilisi led by the “Georgian Dream” coalition is much preferable to the regime of former President Mikheil Saakashvili, now governor of Ukrainian Odessa, whom Russia does not want to see back in power in Georgia.
In Moldova, the EU has been seeking to preserve the country’s European orientation, despite periodic corruption scandals in the ruling coalition and the rise of pro-Russian opposition parties. For Moscow, however, Moldova’s importance cannot be compared to that of Ukraine. The Kremlin is paying attention to the small impoverished country and is supporting its clients there, but it is not prepared to mount a major effort to draw Moldova into its orbit. However, Ukraine’s decision in 2015 to ban Russian military transit to Transnistria, a separatist enclave which broke off from Moldova in 1990, has squeezed the small (1,500 men or so) Russian garrison in the area and raised fears of incidents. This is a latent conflict which should be closely watched, lest it creates another hot spot in Russian–Western relations.
To roll back traditional Russian influence in the Balkans, NATO in 2015 invited Montenegro to join, despite the unsavory reputation of its government – whose leader Milo Jukanovich has been in place for twenty-five years, longer than Belarus’s Lukashenko – and the less than enthusiastic support for membership among ordinary Montenegrins. The EU has also been managing an ever closer association with Serbia (Russia’s main historical ally in the region) and Kosovo. Brussels essentially told Bulgaria, also known for longstanding ties with Russia, to withdraw from Gazprom’s South Stream project. Western capitals monitored closely the flirtations with Moscow of Viktor Orbán’s right-wing government in Hungary and Alexis Tsipras’s left-wing Syriza cabinet in Greece, but eventually concluded that both are simply opportunistic. In any event, a campaign to rid South-Eastern Europe of remnants of Russian influence was in full evidence.

Information warfare
Information space, which despite the confrontation has essentially remained a global commons, has become a major battleground in the new Western–Russian rivalry. The Western mainstream media were virtually unanimous in strongly condemning Russia’s violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty in Crimea, the intervention in Donbass and the downing of the Malaysian plane, and were in wholesale repudiation of the Russian regime, its corruption and backward-looking ideological underpinnings, its cultural conservatism, and its neoimperial ambitions backed by military force. As a result, the image of the Russian Federation in the West is now arguably worse than that of the communist Soviet Union in its heyday. Given such public attitudes, it was probably easier for US and British leaders to engage Joseph Stalin in the 1940s and Leonid Brezhnev in the 1970s than it is for their current successors to reach out to Vladimir Putin.
The Russian state-controlled media, for their part, have launched a most vitriolic campaign against the West, above all the United States. This campaign, too, has broken a few historical records. The disrespect and disdain accorded Vladimir Putin in the West is richly reciprocated by the Russian media depicting US and other Western leaders. Old taboos which were in effect during the Soviet period have been lifted. Apart from the invasion of Iraq, the bombing of Belgrade and the destruction of Libya, the United States stands accused of anything from plotting to dismember Russia to masterminding the Arab Spring to helping create al-Qaeda and ISIS. Arguably, this campaign can be stopped by the Kremlin at a moment’s notice, but the longer it continues, the more of a mark it will leave on Russian people’s minds.
Compared to stale Soviet propaganda, the products of the Russian state-owned media are of superior quality. The Kremlin may have created one of the most efficient and effective public information tools any government possesses in today’s world. Its TV broadcasts are timely, vivid and often highly persuasive, at least for the Russian audience. Vladimir Putin owes part of his phenomenal popularity to Russian television reaching out to ordinary men and women in the country and communicating to them a narrative they believe. Mr Putin himself is an accomplished story-teller, capable of connecting

to the bulk of his electorate. Again, unlike his Soviet forerunners, Putin succeeds in an open information space, where the rate of Internet penetration has reached 72 percent.
There can be no repeat of the high accomplishments of Western propaganda instruments during the Cold War, when, despite the Iron Curtain and the massive Soviet jamming of foreign broadcasts, the BBC, the Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, Radio Liberty and others had millions of listeners across the Soviet Union, who turned to them in search of reliable news and convincing explanations. BBC TV can be had on cable in major Russian cities; Radio Liberty has a studio in downtown Moscow; and VOA is freely available on the Internet. There is even a Russian government-supported web portal, Inosmi.ru, which publishes uncensored translations of all important articles in the Western media about Russia. Rather than hushing up criticism of Russia and its leaders, which the Soviet Union practiced all the time, the Russian state-run media attack this criticism immediately, head-on, and seek to demolish the Western story. Moscow is now not afraid of critical words and counters them with words and images of its own. Most Russians find this approach compelling.
This is one reason why Western counter-propaganda now targets not so much Russians in Russia itself as Russian speakers in the neighboring states, primarily the Baltic countries and Ukraine. The aim is to prevent them from becoming Russia’s “fifth column” on the Western side of the new divide cutting through Europe. This is realistic: the paradox of the common information space is that the media environment in a given area is usually dominated by the prevailing local narrative.
Use of Western soft power
There are few illusions in the West that it can influence Russian domestic politics from the outside. This is not just the result of the measures taken by Putin and his supporters beginning in 2012, such as the law which branded foreign-funded NGOs “foreign agents.” The Russian elites, for all their wealth and familiarity with the West, are anything but pro-Western in their attitudes, outlook and ambitions. They are also closely tied to the Kremlin, with relatively few

defectors. The Russian middle class is relatively small – even in happier times its share of the population was between 15 and 20 percent – and is currently shrinking, hard hit by the crisis. Much of it, moreover, is composed of government officials loyal to the state. The bulk of the Russian population at large – around two-thirds – are staunch Putin supporters. After Crimea, this fan club has swelled by another 20 percent. The pro-Western liberals, many of whom are strongly anti-Putin, are too few and far between, largely disunited and demoralized and, crucially, out of touch with the common people.
The hope of some in the West is that, in the war of values, soft power is their greatest asset. This soft power is most effective when it comes to such issues as peace and prosperity, affluence, prospects of a better future for the next generation, and the general quality of life. However, soft power is much more effective in attracting the more mobile elements in Russian society to emigrate to Europe or North America than in motivating the Russian people in Russia itself to embrace and practice Western values, not to speak of supporting Western policies. Even as the Russian people seek to deal with corruption, lawlessness, arbitrariness, rights abuse and monopolies of various sorts, it is not a given, to put it mildly, that a Russia which shares more values with Western countries will also align its interests with those of the United States or the EU.
Cooperation within confrontation
Western leaders recognize, of course, that it is wrong to see Russia only as a threat. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, having taken a tough stance on Russian violations of the post-Cold War “peace order” in Europe, never stopped reminding others that fixing and maintaining security in Europe required cooperation, even partnership, with Russia. Berlin made it clear that it wanted the implementation of the Minsk II agreement as a prerequisite for normalizing relations between Germany and Russia. France’s François Hollande and other EU leaders also subscribe to that view.
For the United States, the geopolitical importance of Ukraine was never too high, and it waned when the armed conflict there abated. Washington, however, needed Moscow’s assistance in 2015 to

complete the nuclear deal with Iran, which – to the surprise of the White House – did not fall victim to the Ukraine crisis raging at the time. After Iran, the US needed Russia to try to reach a political settlement in Syria, and a degree of cooperation became possible. North Korea’s experimentation with thermonuclear weapons also puts a premium on US–Russian collaboration.
To those fearful of Russia, these elements of cooperation constitute “appeasement” or even amount to a “betrayal” of a principled Western stance. In reality, national interests continue to prevail. The United States and the EU countries will reach out to Russia when they have to – and when they believe that the degree of commonality of interest is sufficient to expect productive collaboration. This, however, does not represent either appeasement or betrayal. Contemporary Western–Russian relations are highly competitive on account of the fundamental clash of interests regarding the global and regional order, and any cooperation between the parties will happen within the wider environment of continued confrontation.
US and EU responses to the Russian challenge suggest that they regard the challenge as real but moderate, manageable primarily by economic means. This may appear reasonable, but it misses the central issue: if the sanctions and other measures fail to bring Russia back into line, how then should the West relate to a major power which rejects the Western-dominated order and shares that attitude with other even more powerful non-Western countries.

4 Navigating the New Normal
To begin with, one needs to recognize that, as time goes by, the West’s challenges related to Russia are not going away or getting smaller. A stronger Russia, should it emerge, will be a stronger challenger; but a weaker and, particularly, a failing Russia will be an even more formidable challenge to deal with. One also needs from the start to drop any residual illusions about a Russia somehow reassociated with the West and more or less following its lead. That window is permanently closed.
Russia looks ossified, even petrified, under the current leadership, which has been in place for over a decade and a half. Yet, it will change, either more smoothly, as a result of policies from above interacting with processes from below, or perhaps abruptly, in unexpected ways and without much prior warning, as it has done a couple of times in its modern history. However, even as Russia changes, it will be different from the West and even from its neighbors in Central Europe such as Poland. Russia will act in its own way and will not be subject to Western-designed norms and conventions in either domestic or international behavior.
Russia will continue to compete with the West. The West’s hope that Russia will inevitably succumb to the pressure of economic factors, such as the low oil price and economic sanctions, resulting also in the lack of investment and a ban on technology transfers, is so far just a hope. Even if Russia continues on a downward path, this descent may be long and will not necessarily lead to a friendlier policy vis-àvis the West. The opposite is at least as likely. Pro-Western political and social forces within Russia are at their weakest in decades. Popular Russian nationalism defines itself as frankly anti-Western.
Competition and rivalry is not all there is to the West’s relationship with Russia. There are compelling reasons for cooperation in a few selected areas. As already mentioned, in the field of WMD nonproliferation, Moscow has continued to interact productively with Washington and others on Iran and North Korea, despite the general

atmosphere of US–Russian confrontation. In Syria, Russia is key to the future political and military developments.
Over time, Russia may have to become more involved in Afghanistan and Central Asia in order to oppose armed radicals there. Up to a point, its interests will be aligned with those of the West. With Islamist extremism a rising threat to Russia itself, Moscow will continue to fight terrorism both within its own borders and internationally. The transnational nature of contemporary terrorism makes Moscow a valuable partner to Western governments, whatever they think about Putin or his regime.
Thus, Russia in the foreseeable future will be primarily a competitor but may also occasionally – and within the general environment of competition – be a partner of the West. Under the present politicoeconomic system, it is likely to continue on a declining trajectory, but its military power will grow for the time being. This unequal mix of competition and cooperation, economic decline and military expansion, will make crafting a Western policy toward Russia a particularly difficult task. This task can be divided into elements, each with its own time horizon.
Taking risk-reduction measures
In the short term, the focus has to be on ensuring that the West’s relations with Russia do not get out of control and lead to a dangerous collision that no one wants. The conflict in Ukraine’s east is now undergoing a lull, but it may be reignited and expand beyond the present battlefield. The number one priority is to make sure that it is safely controlled. It is too much to expect the West to pressure Ukraine into implementing Minsk II, which Kiev hates and Moscow likes. The least bad way under the circumstances would be to build a firewall around the zone of conflict to make sure that it does not spread.
It is also highly important to agree with Russia in avoiding any provocation involving Russian and US/NATO military assets and forces, in Europe and elsewhere. Accidents involving military aircraft and naval ships are particularly dangerous. It is also necessary to avoid provocative military exercises along the new line of the military

stand-off on Russia’s north-western borders in Europe. As such exercises will continue in the absence of conventional arms control in Europe, some transparency would help. The purpose of the exercises can only be conventional deterrence, as actual war-fighting between Russia and NATO would almost certainly lead to a nuclear catastrophe.
A related issue is military deployments. So far, NATO has abided by the terms of the Founding Act on relations with Russia, which rules out large-scale military deployments and massive military infrastructure development in the eastern member countries. With Russia–NATO cooperation over, and relations downgraded virtually to Cold War levels, there is pressure building up to terminate the constraints and deploy substantial foreign (preferably US) forces and bases in the Baltic States and Poland. If this happens, the relationship between the West and Russia will become even more militarized, with Moscow probably seeking to counter Western conventional troop presence on its borders with a nuclear threat to the United States and its European allies.
This may also be Russia’s reaction to the deployment of US ballistic missile defenses in Eastern Europe and East Asia, ostensibly to counter missile threats from Iran and North Korea. Even though the Russian nuclear deterrent will not lose its effectiveness in the foreseeable future, these US deployments will not be ignored. In the asymmetrical situation of the lack of military balance between Russia and NATO, Moscow will have to rely more heavily on its strategic offensive systems. With traditional nuclear arms control between Washington and Moscow now history, it will be important for both sides at least to engage in a dialogue to help avoid erroneous assessment and resultant miscalculation.
This would require, at a minimum, keeping lines of communication open. Multilateral fora such as the UN Security Council, the NATO– Russia Council, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will need to have a bigger role to play. The institutions which functioned during the Cold War should assume some of the familiar functions; the bodies built in the hope of cooperation would need to be transformed into platforms for managing conflict. It is important that dialogue in all these organizations is not stopped as punishment

for Russian behavior or in protest at Western actions; rather, it is in the crisis periods that such bodies will be particularly, maybe critically, useful.
In an environment where top-level communications have virtually broken down and only transactional foreign policy is able to operate, it is highly desirable for small groups of trusted individuals from both sides, who enjoy the confidence of their national leaders as well as each other, to carry on with more broad-ranging dialogue on managing the adversarial relationship and organizing cooperative projects where the parties’ interests approximate or coincide. These projects might range from the fight against extremism, to stemming radicalism, to the diplomatic process on crises such as Syria, to efforts to prevent WMD proliferation, and to less controversial issues such as dealing with infectious diseases and climate change.
Toward a new security arrangement in Europe and Greater Eurasia
In the medium and long term, it is necessary to work toward a new security arrangement in Europe and Greater Eurasia. The well-worn concept of European security needs to be rethought. By tradition, it was based on balances: initially among European states themselves, and later between the two blocs led by the United States and the Soviet Union. In the post-Cold War era an attempt was made to organize it around NATO, which was to expand to include virtually all of Europe except for Russia, which would be linked to the system by a special partnership arrangement. This attempt has failed, but there is no going back to the old blocbased equilibrium. Russia has no real bloc to lead. Russia alone cannot balance NATO. However, the geopolitical framework has expanded beyond Europe.
Just as in the twentieth century European security expanded across the Atlantic, its twenty-first-century version also needs to expand, this time in the opposite direction to embrace all of Greater Eurasia. With China moving west toward Europe along its “One Belt, One Road” route, Russia looking toward Asia and the Middle East, and the United States repositioning itself with regard to both Asia and Europe, the security interests of the great powers across the entire continent of Eurasia are becoming more closely intertwined. Thus, twenty-first-century security arrangements will have to include

China, as in the last century they came to include America. This expansion, however, is nothing like the Cold War situation when the United States came to the rescue of Western Europe. China is not coming to the rescue of a weakened Russia, and Eurasia is not becoming an area of intense Sino-American rivalry. The picture is more complex.
The transcontinental, transoceanic system which is emerging not just in Eurasia but in the northern hemisphere includes three great powers: the United States, China and Russia. It also includes a number of US allies that generally follow its lead but are powerful economically: the countries of the European Union, plus Japan, Turkey and South Korea. There is also a potential fourth great power, India, whose might and ambitions will significantly expand over time, and there are a number of important regional players, such as Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.
To be minimally stable, the emerging system will need to rest on the basic principle of rough equilibrium among the great powers, some sort of balance between competing regional ones, and adequate protection to others. This will require creating a situation in which all key elements – i.e., great powers – are essentially satisfied that their security is not threatened by one or both of the other great powers. Regional powers would be safely balanced by their competitors or by the rest of the region. And all other countries would be sufficiently protected by means of alliances, partnerships and credible guarantees.
Although by far the weakest of the three great powers, Russia will play a pivotal role in that system. This follows from its geography, which reaches from Eastern and Northern Europe to East and Central Asia, and from the Arctic to the Caspian; from its natural and human resources; from its nuclear and conventional military power; and from its vast international experience as a European, Eurasian and global player over the course of many centuries. Of particular importance is Russia’s strong determination to play solo, not being the junior partner or tributary state of anyone – in today’s world, Washington or Beijing.
While Russia is pivotal – aligning itself with different players while always following its own self-interest – its role will not be central.

The central stage will be occupied by the United States, seeking to protect and prolong its global dominance, and China, the rising challenger to that dominance. A Sino-Russian alliance is improbable for the same reason that the US–Russian one never came about: Moscow will not recognize the other partner’s leadership, and the other partner would find Russia too difficult and ultimately unnecessary to humor. However, following the rupture between Russia and the West, the Sino-Russian rapprochement has reached the level of genuine entente that others need to take seriously.
China and Russia share an intense resentment of US global dominance. They both advocate a world order based on great-power equilibrium, although, while China dreams of a new kind of bipolarity, Russia is wedded to a “polycentric” system of several major players. Like Moscow, Beijing is adamantly opposed to a Western-supported spread of democracy and defends the existing political regime in the name of national sovereignty. Like Russia, China is seeking to dominate its neighborhood in the name of the national interest. It employs a strikingly different strategy from Russia’s in Crimea and Ukraine, but it clearly regards Taiwan, the islands in the East China Sea and much of the South China Sea as its core interests. For Beijing, increasing its influence in the neighborhood and eventually across Eurasia is a key part of the strategy of China’s global rise.
So far, in view of its evident limitations and potential for rivalry, the United States has been relaxed about the evolution of the Russian– Chinese relationship. This attitude, however, is overly complacent. Russia is not China’s equal, but neither is it its satellite. In principle, under a different system of governance and management, and with an economic model that encourages development and innovation, it could marshal enough resources and unchain sufficient potential to become a formidable and effective player. Russia’s decline is a reality, but whether this is terminal or temporary is an open question yet to be answered by the Russian people. In a number of key areas – military and foreign affairs, diplomacy, intelligence – Russia continues to be ahead of China. It does not have many allies, but it has pragmatically partnered with a number of countries, including India and Vietnam. Moscow has not written Tokyo off, and it keeps up a productive relationship with Seoul.

China and Russia are not going to clash over Central Asia, as some in the West have long been prophesying, and, while they will not build a formal alliance, Russia will be contributing to the growth of China’s air and sea power. As the two militaries exercise together, Beijing and Moscow will continue cooperating closely on world order and regional security issues. As the competition between China and the United States grows more intense, what China can get from Russia will become more important. The strategic triangle of Washington, Beijing and Moscow has mutated over the past forty-plus years, but it has not vanished as some thought. However, it has lost its salient feature: Washington no longer dominates. It is Beijing which now has better relations with Washington and Moscow than the latter two have between themselves.
This situation challenges the West to come up with a broader strategic approach. To have any chance of acceptance, the transcontinental/transoceanic security arrangement needs to be guided by the principles of politico-ideological pluralism and mutual respect. This will be a hard sell in the West and will probably result in the simultaneous preaching of values in public and a hard-nosed pursuit of interest in reality. The arrangement cannot be managed within a single overarching institution. Rather, better use will need to be made of the multiple existing institutions while ensuring better connectivity and interaction among them. Thus, the OSCE might find it useful to talk to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO); China could harmonize its “One Belt, One Road” project not only with the Eurasian Economic Union but also with the EU; and so on.
The Russia policy
In this broader picture, relations with Russia are but one, albeit important, element. Basically, the choice for the West in that relationship is between containment and engagement on mutually agreed terms. For now, containment is winning. Russia remains under pressure politically and economically. In the domain of public information, it is pictured as a rogue state led by a gang of criminal, corrupt, and even murderous figures. This approach, however, hinges on the expectation of Russia’s inevitable decline and hopes of

a political transformation that would return the country to the Western orbit which it left in the mid-2000s.
Dealing with a disintegrating Russia would again, as twenty-five years ago in the case of the collapsing USSR, demand maximum attention to the issues of assuring nuclear security and preventing WMD proliferation. Much else could be borrowed from contemporary history books, but one key element will be missing: unlike in the final days of the Soviet Union and the first days of the new Russian Federation, the West will have few friends in the Kremlin or among the Russian elites, whether outgoing or incoming. It would also have to deal with a population which would blame their woes largely on malicious Western policies.
And, very important, since a disintegrating Russia would present a major danger to China, Beijing can be expected to play a key role in preventing Russia’s collapse. While the end of the Soviet Union presented a historic chance to the West, which it chose not to use, a severely weakened Russia could become an opportunity to China to reach out and help it recover, so as to make a claim on its resources and exercise long-term influence on its policies. Should this happen, the geopolitical axis of Eurasia would shift.
This, however, is not necessarily what the future holds. As demonstrated in chapter 3, some Western policies, such as sanctions, can be and are counter-productive. Russia’s current economic model is unsustainable, and its governance is appalling. Russia is in deep crisis, which can be likened to a severe illness. However, as is common in such cases, if the patient does not die, he will get stronger. If Russia goes down and disintegrates again, the West will be presented with one set of problems; if it recovers, the challenge will be bigger than it is now.
A Russia which has recovered and set out on a path of economic and technological development would be of interest to European business circles. Investments would again become profitable, and the Russian market of 145 million consumers would look more attractive. At some point, some sanctions would have to be eased or even lifted. There would be no emergence of a Greater Europe from Lisbon to Vladivostok, but some form of relationship between the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union would make

sense after the latter has survived the test of the present economic crisis. This would not make Russia “part of Europe,” but it might eventually lead to the two becoming partners in selected areas.
An economically stronger Russia would make its foreign policy even more effective. Russia has made a difference even when it was weak but punching above its weight. If it becomes stronger, it will make much more of a difference. With both its own integration into the West and the former Russian provinces’ integration into a Greater Russia no longer viable options, a Russia which is a single major nation-state, global in its outlook and interacting with all its neighbors in Greater Eurasia – the EU, China, India, Japan, SouthEast Asia and the Middle East – plus others elsewhere, could be an influential world player. The West should also be prepared for this outcome, no matter how unlikely it may seem at the moment.
Dealing with a stronger Russia, but one which no longer sees itself as part of the Euro-Atlantic community – which was Moscow’s official policy line as recently as six years ago – will not be easy. Competition, if anything, will intensify. Russia’s main goal at the global level is the establishment of a polycentric world order which would end the centuries-old domination of the West and cut short the second American century. In pursuit of this goal, Russia would broadly align itself with China, India, Brazil, Iran and a number of other non-Western countries.
Such an alignment would not result in permanent coalitions built around such fora as BRICS or SCO. There are serious issues within the non-West, not least between China and India. Moscow and Beijing do not always see eye to eye, and they have a host of practical issues to sort out in addition to some historical baggage. The nonWest is not going to evolve into anything like the present-day West, a homogeneous community of like-minded nations with a set of shared values and undisputed leadership provided by the United States. Yet, with the addition of Russia from 2014, this group has gained a particularly combative great power.
The “new normal” of competition and even confrontation will last years. It might end sooner if the Russian Federation breaks down under the pressure of rivalry, like the Russian Empire did in the midst of World War I. The West would then have to deal with the

consequences of another major collapse following that of the Soviet Union twenty-five years ago. There is no guarantee that it would be as relatively orderly and peaceful as the dismantlement of the USSR.
The competition might last longer if Russia is lucky enough to avoid a cataclysmic scenario but still lacks the will to begin improving its economy and overall governance. Then the West would be dealing with a country which would be simultaneously declining economically yet still able to marshal sufficient resources in the military sector to ensure its own security and pursue an active foreign policy, defying US global dominance.
In the seemingly unlikely but not totally impossible scenario of Russia using its confrontation with the world’s most powerful country to diversify and modernize its economy, overhaul and upgrade its scientific and technological base, and radically improve governance at all levels – particularly by means of prizing competence and reducing corruption – it may become an even more formidable competitor with the West. In other words, a successfully modernized Russia would not again seek to join the West but, rather, press it harder to protect its interests and promote its own worldview. Whatever Russia’s future, the conflict with the West is helping shape it.

Conclusion: How Conflict with the West
Impacts on Russia
Over the centuries, Russia’s relations with the West have been a combination of a desire to emulate the more advanced nations of Europe, and to learn from them, and an effort to preserve its own identity and provide security vis-à-vis Europe’s hegemonic powers – and, more recently, the United States and its NATO allies. For periods of time, Russia dominated much of Central and Eastern Europe and was both the policeman of the continent and the hegemonic oppressor of other countries’ freedom. The end of the twentieth century witnessed an unprecedented attempt by postimperial Russia to join the West, become an integral part of it, and be accepted as a major Western power, second only, but not subservient to the United States. This one of-a-kind adventure, however, has ended in failure.
Russia shares the blame for the way this has ended. The Kremlin has blundered its way into the disaster in Ukraine: first by believing that Ukraine could be integrated into the Eurasian Union project, then by mistaking the Maidan for a US-hatched plot, and finally by embarking on the “Novorossia” misadventure. It has recklessly gambled with the goodwill of the Europeans, above all the Germans, bought at a very high price at the end of the Cold War and carefully sustained for a quarter-century after that. Putin’s misreading of the German reaction to Crimea was stunning. Finally, Moscow’s rupture with the West put it in an awkward position of overreliance on China, an unsentimental would-be superpower that, like the United States, does not regard Russia as its equal. Such “Realpolitik” does not serve the Russian national interest at all.
The present confrontation between Russia and the West is just two years old, but the rift is getting deeper by the week. This confrontation is highly asymmetrical. In all relevant areas, the power of the United States, not to speak of the West as a whole, exceeds that of Russia by the widest margin. The Kremlin genuinely fears USdesigned, US-sponsored and US-directed “color revolutions.” The

Russian security community fears Western spying and its penetration of Russian officialdom and elites. The General Staff is concerned about the movement of NATO infrastructure toward Russia’s borders, the US ballistic missile defenses, and strategic nonnuclear systems.
Many of these fears are groundless or over-blown. NATO has certainly refocused on Russia and is now busy organizing new defenses. A nuclear superpower like Russia, however, has every reason to be confident about the power and effectiveness of its ultimate deterrent. Surprise invasions and decapitating strikes against Russia are prohibitively risky, and neutralizing its nuclear systems by means of ballistic missile defense will be out of the question for several decades to come. Similarly, a non-nuclear strike against Russia’s strategic assets can never achieve adequate success to protect the attacker against Moscow’s retaliation.
Thus, Russia has no serious reason to fear the West. Contrary to some popular inventions, the United States has no intention of breaking the Russian Federation into pieces and taking over the “juicier” parts. Western Europeans generally harbor no ill will toward Russia. Japan will not seek the return of the South Kuril Islands by force, and Canada will not attack Russian possessions in the Arctic. Poland, the Baltic States and Romania will remain frankly hostile and Britain and Sweden highly skeptical toward it, but none of these countries can mount a credible threat. Erdoğan’s Turkey, of course, is a country to watch, but Russia has a range of assets to prevent or contain the threat of a direct collision.
Russia, however, cannot afford to take the present confrontation/alienation lightly. Moscow’s breakout from the postCold War order carries a high price, to be paid over a long period of time. It cannot hope to defeat its former partners turned adversaries, but it can either use the stand-off as a challenge to improve its own ways or else succumb to it and seal its downward socio-economic and political trajectory. In the past two years, the Kremlin has been managing the situation while keeping the fundamentals of the politico-economic system intact. So far, it has shown neither a plan nor much of a desire to come up with a model that would encourage

economic development and support entrepreneurship and innovation in the country.
If this continues much longer, it will be bad, and potentially tragic for the country. In the present situation of long-term confrontation with the West the consequences could be dire. Like World War I, which began with an apparent surge of Russian patriotism and support for the Romanov dynasty but finished off the empire and the dynasty within three years, the present conflict with the West, which started exactly a century later, has the potential to bring latent domestic tensions to a head. Russia is not a country where leaders are changed every four, five or six years by means of a ballot box, but it is a fact that in the last century the Russian people brought down the entire Russian state twice. The last such cataclysmic event occurred twentyfive years ago.
Russia’s present crisis is the worst since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with the future as difficult to foresee. In contrast to that of Gorbachev, Putin’s foreign policy is unlikely to grow more conciliatory as the crisis worsens, but the post-Putin era will probably provide a repudiation of many of the current practices, including in foreign policy. Russia, of course, will stay Russia: it will not attempt a new “docking” with Europe, but it may look for accommodation with it and with other neighbors. Such accommodation can only be shallow, given the differences in political, social, economic and values systems, but it might be sufficient to defuse many of the current risks. As a result, Russia’s Realpolitik may become more realistic.
Whereas the challenge to the West regarding Russia is essentially a foreign policy issue, the challenge facing Russia in its stand-off with the West is overwhelmingly a domestic one. The real battlefield for Moscow is neither Ukraine nor Syria, but Russia itself. How Moscow manages the crisis and whether it succeeds in putting the country on a development trajectory will crucially depend on the Russian elites. So far, they have been found lacking. The question is whether they can rise to the challenge of relaunching the Russian economy. Should they fail, Russia’s future certainly looks bleak.

Further Reading
There is a small library of literature on present-day Russia and its foreign policy. Much of it is devoted to the person of Vladimir Putin. Quite a few books are obviously polemical, and many are superficial. I will supply the reader with a reasonably short list of titles, which, I should add, with just one exception, depict the difficult relationship between Russia, on the one hand, and the United States and Europe, on the other, from a Western standpoint.
Serious works on the issue of relations between Russia and the West include Georgetown University Professor Angela Stent’s treatise on the US–Russian relations, The Limits of Partnership: US–Russian Relations in the Twenty-First Century (Princeton University Press, 2014), which appeared on the eve of the Ukraine crisis, and Columbia University Professor Emeritus Robert Legvold’s Return to Cold War (Polity, 2016).
Specifically on this seminal crisis, I would recommend Conflict in Ukraine: The Unwinding of the Post-Cold War Order, by Lehigh University’s Rajan Menon and my Carnegie colleague Eugene Rumer (MIT Press, 2015); Kent University Professor Richard Sakwa’s Frontline Ukraine: Crisis in the Borderlands (I. B. Tauris, 2015); British researcher Andrew Wilson’s Ukraine Crisis: What it Means for the West; and veteran journalist and Brookings scholar Marvin Kalb’s Imperial Gamble: Putin, Ukraine, and the New Cold War (Brookings Institution Press, 2015).
On the wider issue of Moscow’s foreign policy, I would recommend Andrei P.

Russian Effort to Return the Global Role and Adjust the International Balance in the 21st Century

Sabah Naas Shanafah, Mohamed Aziz Abdel Hassan
University of Baghdad, Baghdad, Iraq
Russian philosopher Ivan Eileen thinks Russia’s role in the world as a superpower. The great power is not limited to the size of the territory or the population, but through the ability of the people and their government to shoulder the burden of major international tasks and to deal with these tasks creatively. Since 2000, Russia has sought to restore the role of the global force in resolving international crisis, management, and decision-making. It has also used its power as a superpower to defend its vital interests in the world with skillful diplomacy at the political and economic levels. By the use of military force, the Russian president Vladimir Putin has a central role in the Russian vision of the world role and the restoration of international balance in favor of the Russian federation.
Keywords: Russian, return, global role, adjust international balance
The concept of the global political role develops through the behavior of the state concerned and its political positions towards the issues and the hierarchy of the international system, which is an influential part in its formation. The more it affects the values of the regime and the order of its hierarchy, the more it indicates the global active role of that state. As for the international balance, Ismail Sabri said, “It is a tool through which states can organize conflicts of power between them so as to ensure the continuation of the existing international order, protect its independence and prevent the ingestion of its national entity by superior international forces”.
The dynamics of the Russian-United States (U.S.) relationship over the past two decades have seemed unstable and unpredictable, to some extent, by other parties in the regional and international arenas.
It is difficult to find a country other than the U.S., whose relationship with Russia has been very sharp in so short a time. The periods of effective political dialogue between both governments (U.S. and Russian) have been interrupted by sudden interruptions that led to Moscow and Washington accusing each other of failing to meet treaty obligations or keeping commitments.
Moscow is dealing with Washington and their regional and international interests, particularly their differing interests in the Middle East and North Africa, on a case-by-case basis, and then changing its behavior with Washington accordingly.
Both governments (U.S. and Russian) are coming to an alliance on their sensitive issues in the Middle East, but as a result of mutual interests in various issues of equal importance and priority to Moscow. In this sense, it

RUSSIAN EFFORT TO RETURN THE GLOBAL ROLE

cannot be said that the development of Russian-U.S. relations is absolutely unpredictable. It is subject to certain rules.
Despite Moscow’s lack of a unified plan of action or a clear perception of top priorities toward Washington, it has clear national interests in Syria, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Israel, and its foreign policy is based on those interests. It is unlikely that the U.S. stand in front of Russia to change its attitude based on those interests to the success of this policy.
In contrast, there are several important worries of Russia’s foreign policy toward the U.S., which cannot be ignored, most notably national security issues. One of the important worry of Moscow’s foreign policy is that it does not accept any active military presence of the U.S./North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) near the Russian border or in areas and it considers being within the sphere of Russian political interests and aspirations.
Because of Russia’s inability to keep up with the military political challenges of the U.S./NATO, Moscow is instead resorting to asymmetrical retaliatory measures. These measures include the temporary intensification of cooperation with opponents of Washington and Europe. As a result, one can always trace the link between periods of improved Russian-Iranian relations and periods of faltering Moscow’s dialogue with the West.
In these circumstances, Russia is using Iran, Syria, and Turkey as pressure cards in its political dialogue with the U.S. and Israel, where the Russian authorities played these cards during periods of rapprochement and tension with the U.S. and Israel, especially the Syrian and Iranian papers, and specifically the Iranian paper either by freezing or strengthening cooperation with Iran other times.
And that the geopolitical change witnessed by the Russian state at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century had born the “emotional vacuum” of the Russian people associated with belonging to the superpower, and the Russian leadership’s perception of the seriousness of the American-Western blockade of the territory of Russia and deprive it of its former vital area, and the deployment of U.S. military bases on the outer wall of the territory of Russia. The Russian foreign strategy was designed to adopt the approach of the “national state” whose mission is to preserve the historical existence of the Russian nation in the form of greatness and to affirm the leading role in the hierarchy of the international order.
The hypothesis of our research stems from two basic bases: (1) The Russian approach after the year 2000 in the management of foreign relations fulfills the demand to restore the global role of Russia and adjust the international balance; (2) Russia’s strength and geopolitical position in its regional and international relations is based on its firm belief that the fundamental principle of peace and justice is not limited to diplomatic action but also depends on the element of war and conflict through the management of strategic conflict through its associated actors. The new task is to work with all the regional powers in favor of the growing Russian power in the Middle East, to be able to extend its influence, to present itself multiple faces, and to deal with many countries and centers of regional prominent powers in the region, notably Turkey, Israel, and Iran. The analytical approach and the content analysis methodology were adopted. The importance of the study comes from the new turn in the global role of the state of the Russian federation in the formation of international alliances and economic blocs and the management of international crisis to achieve the prestige and the role of global leadership of Russia again. The first section is a reading of the geopolitical variables that changed the map of the nation and the Russian material strength. In the second section, the incentives to build strength and return to play the dominant

role and participate in global decision-making are shown by the influence of Russian elites and leadership. The third section will follow the geopolitical approach adopted by the Russian leadership in its effort to return the global role and adjust the international balance through a series of new blocs and alliances with regional forces across the world.
Geopolitical Changes of the State of Russia
The basic geopolitical principle of “the relation of the state to the place” had undergone a major change and cracking of the great Russian state with a global message, either by its Tsarist or Soviet heritage, and by the widespread loss of its power and influence over the regional and popular size and economic resources enjoyed by Russian power. In 1991, Russia was fragmented to 15 independent states. The Russia’s Moscow used to influence a territory of 22,276,060 km2; shrank to 17,075,400 km2 in 2000, and its population shrank from 293,047,571 million to 143 million. These geopolitical changes have deprived central Moscow of its domination and leadership of the Eastern European Continent (the former communist states and members of the Warsaw Pact), which was considered the advanced location of the defense line and the expansion of Russian power. These lands were defined by Western geopolitical scientists as the heart of the world and the key to world domination. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, parts of it turned into a pro-Western military front and a U.S. force on the outer wall of Russia when Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania joined the NATO, and Russia’s gas pipelines to Western European countries extending under the Baltic Sea. On the Caspian side, Russia used to control most of the geopolitics of the sea and its sovereignty was also divided.
The sea became under the control of five countries: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and Russia. Before 1991, it was a Russian and Iranian lake overlooking Russia on the Great Ocean, which meant that Russia lost large shares of sea production. Of the oil, where Caspian oil reserves are estimated at up to 4% of the world’s reserves, with natural gas reserves up to 7% of the world’s reserves, according to the International Energy Agency. The most serious geopolitical variable is the concentration of U.S. military bases in the Tajik, Turkmen, Uzbek, and Georgian territories, all of which surround the new Russian entity, with the existence of old military bases close to Russia as well as in Turkey, Cyprus, South Korea, the Philippines, Afghanistan, and Norway.
The American power has long regarded Russia as the historical impediment to the spread of American hegemony across the European world and the whole world. The Russian history shows that any Russian military approach to Moscow reinforces Russian power and power not only to defeat the military invasion but to achieve a global expansion and expansion of Russian power. The attempt to invade Moscow by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1812 followed not only the defeat of the invading army, European territories and annexes of Ukraine, Belarus, and the Caucasus. When the German Nazi armies tried to invade Moscow in 1941, Russian forces were pushed to expel the invaders and expand again at the expense of the European territories, including the Kalyina region of Finland, Malavia and Persavia of Romania, and the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
The events of 2014, in which the U.S. called for the entry of Ukraine into NATO and because Ukraine is only 180 km away from Moscow, the Russian military force to occupy the Crimea in order to stop the U.S. West Crawling aimed to narrow its vital area and threaten its security and entity, and to confirm their ability to rebalance for its benefit in the region.

RUSSIAN EFFORT TO RETURN THE GLOBAL ROLE

The Driving Force for the Restoration of the Role and Global Leadership of Russia
States begin to build their strength in terms of international relations by employing the elements of power available to them. These elements include population structure, political culture, the type of political leadership, as well as the state’s strategic economic resources. On the subject of the population, the Russian people still bear the characteristics of the faithful of Russia’s historical message and the importance of Russian power to lead the world. Some Russian intellectuals believe that the reconstruction of the Russian Empire is the only formula for the proper and natural existence of the Russian people and as the only possibility of reaching its historical and cultural mission.
The emotional vacuum left by the historical event “the collapse and disintegration of the Soviet Union” calls for new values and ideals to replace the feelings of greatness that the Russian person has been singing throughout history. But the rise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who works and emphasizes the need to view Russia as a successor to Soviet power and dissatisfaction with regional roles of Russian heritage since the establishment of the Eurasian Power Center in Moscow as a symbol of that historical power. The Russian State Duma, a total of 238 members of the State Duma, 156 deputies, organize and believe in the united Prussia and Communist’s thought.
The united Russia, President Putin’s party has 92 seats and the Communist Party holds 64 seats. Russian president Vladimir Putin has been elected as president since 2000 and President Putin has the characteristics of “attraction and payment” that attract the nation toward him and drive them toward the highest goals of the nation under the influence of the leader. Henry Kissinger presents an analytical reading of Putin’s personality,
He is a figure who came from the world of the secret police, and progress in the shade suggests a strong nationalism and a cold analytical tone, leading to a foreign policy that can be compared to the policy pursued by the tsars seeking to dominate the neighboring countries.
Former secretary of State Hillary Clinton also confirmed Putin’s description:
Putin’s view of the world is shaped by his admiration of the powerful Kaisers of Russian history, Russia’s long-term interest in controlling the countries on its borders, and his personal determination that his country should never be shown again. Weak is at the mercy of the West.
The foregoing shows the U.S. politicians’ opinions on Putin’s approach to force-making and the attempt to regain Russia’s leading and dominant role in its geostrategic environment.
Putin confirmed this perception in an article in a Russian newspaper by saying that his intention to regain the lost power in the former republics and create a strong super-nationalism, able to become a pole in the modern world.
From the historical experiences of the nations, political leadership has a crucial role to play in confirming and following up on the nation’s mission and making successful and effective foreign policy decisions. In particular, as the German geopolitical analyst (Carl Schmidt) points out, “Achieving the lebensraum theory is linked to political will alone, which recognize the historical necessity of such a geopolitical move”.
Putin’s global ambitions support Russia’s acquisition of the necessary strategic goods and services for the various countries of the world. Oil, natural gas, arms trade, technology, fellowships, space research, and the power of Russia’s voice in the United Nations (UN) Security Council are all sources of strength under which

Russia relies and sometimes controls the type of relationship and Russian power over political decisions and its relationship with the CIS (Association States Independent) countries from the former Soviet Union.
Russian Efforts to Restore Balance and Control the Global Role
The task of geopolitics is to use the facts of the place and its strengths to support the political decision. Russian decision-makers have realized that their geopolitical loss in their western front and the end of their vital area in Eastern Europe can be compensated by Asian.
In addition to the power outlets around the world, and the dual movement on the level of regional and global powers and in all areas of economic, technological, and military power, and the coordination of international stances, especially in the Security Council. Russian leaders also used the “carrot” without the stick. The Russians used their energy, oil, natural gas, arms trade, space technology, and nuclear energy to manage new axes and economic blocs that create a world front separate from and rival to the American-Western world.
Russian thinkers believe that the world’s transformation from unilateralism to bipolarize is done only by the Russian-Chinese alliance, so Russia has moved toward China to create an Asian political bloc that is central to the rest of the Asian powers of common interest, which at the same time rejects American-Western domination.
Russia and China have veto power in the security council, the coordination of political positions at the international level in support of the weight of the Russian voice, as a result of these trends created the “Shanghai Cooperation Organization” in 2001, which collected all Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan (Central Asian countries) and four observers—India, Iran, Mongolia, and Pakistan, as well as dialogue partners Sri Lanka and Belarus. The bilateral agreement between China and Russia has increased to bring the Brix in 2009 and this time to form a qualitative bloc of civilizations. The membership includes Russia, China, and India from the continent of Asia and South Africa from the African continent and Brazil from the South America continent.
To translate this step as a global trend to reduce and stop U.S. hegemony, and the globalization of the world, Brix Group created the New Development Bank in 2014 with a capital of $100 billion to provide soft loans in competition with U.S. hegemony over World Bank policies. The Brix Group has been characterized by a world of aspirations for global roles and regional powers. The famous economist Leonid Biochesky believes that the Brix gathering is more than a political gesture, but a threat and bargaining tool.
In the area of strengthening the role and position of global leadership, and impose the will and vision of Russia in the management of crisis and international problems, Russia is active diplomatic force in talks to resolve the problem of the West-U.S. nuclear dispute with Iran in 2015 and the crisis of political transformation in Syria. The last two crises are linked to the position of Russia’s quest for the world stage and impose its political and economic momentum, changing Russian geography shifted attention to its vital interests in the southern neighborhood and where Iran shared the Caspian oil resources with Russia. Iran is an oil and gas exporting country and Iran is the closest area to access to the Arab Gulf countries with the international energy and weapons trade routes. Iran is starting to be regional power in the Middle East, especially after growing influence in Iraq and Syria. Since 2003, the importance of the State of Syria in the Russian strategy is due to the plans for the transfer of Qatari gas through Syria to Europe, which threatens Russia’s control of the gas market in Europe and weakens its negotiating position in determining prices or other crisis. Syria is easier connection with the Arab political arena in addition to the presence of the Russian military base in Tartous, which gives Russia the possibility of military presence in the Mediterranean.

RUSSIAN EFFORT TO RETURN THE GLOBAL ROLE

This requirement in the Russian naval strategy of 2015 focuses on the need for a permanent naval presence for the Russian fleet in the Mediterranean, which will bring Russia closer to or enter the waters of the Red Sea and presence in the Horn of Africa and the Arab South.
On the other hand, the location in the waters of the Mediterranean is close to the Strait of Gibraltar and from it to the waters of the Atlantic, where the wider opening on the borders of the European West and North Africa and the interests of the Atlantic America. Russia is still imposing its vision in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
Russia is working to support the ruling regime on the pretext of avoiding the collapse of the Syrian state and creating chaos, as happened in Iraq after the events of political change in 2003. In the Arab region, Russia is seeking to establish a cartel of natural gas exporting countries with Algeria and Libya so that Russia can control the energy market towards the need of European energy markets.
Russia also moved to Venezuela in violation of the Monroe Principles of 1823 and the Alliance for Progress, which was adopted by the administration of President Kennedy in 1962 and which limits power in the South American continent to the hegemony and power of the U.S. Today, Venezuela is the main partner of the arms trade in America Latin with Russia.
Brazil joined the Brix economic bloc, but the two countries—Venezuela and Brazil, led the policy of forming alliances against the dominance of the U.S. in the South American continent.
In Russia and the United States, nuclear weapons are part of strategic nuclear forces, including ground forces for strategic missions, submarines equipped with nuclear warheads, strategic air launchers equipped with nuclear warheads, and nuclear bombs. Although there are strategic nuclear forces in the armies of the two countries, Russia and the United States are a key element in determining the balance of power between them.
The Russian surface-to-surface missile is composed of three types of missiles: SS-19, known as Steelet, SS-25, known as Tepl, and SS-27, known as Nuclear Charge. The United States relies on its ground forces on the Minitmen-3 and the MX, which in the ground forces are 550 missiles with 500 nuclear warheads.
However, experts and military analysts confirm that there is a disparity between the two countries (the United States and Russia) in the number of missiles and nuclear warheads.
The disparity between the two countries in the number of missiles and nuclear warheads operating within the ground strategic forces is due to the nature of their respective missions, which are determined by the geopolitical location of each country. Russia is a land force that forms the heart of Eurasia, where political scientists gather that those who control it control the world, so its army is limited to protecting this land and trying to break through the sea.
The US military is an Atlantic naval force, whose task is to impose control over Eurasian territory, and to ensure that the naval force is superior and secures global hegemony.
The small difference in the number of missiles carrying nuclear warheads in the two countries’ land forces is due to the fact that Russia has to secure the broadest possible protection for its wide prowess and areas of influence. It also relies on the ground nuclear force as a strike force, spreading within areas that can hit its targets at any point in the world, which can not be said about the United States, so it distributes the largest number of nuclear warheads on strategic bombers, and naval forces, which are deployed around the world, in an attempt to balance with Russian.

Conclusions
After the arrival of elected president—Vladimir Putin, he tries to play the role of global power and to enter strongly in the management of global crisis, impose the Russian vision in international decision-making, and sought to expand the circle of supporters and allies at the global level. For example, the establishment of a gathering and the attempt to set up a cartel for gas producing countries in the world are included. Russia also succeeded in its diplomatic efforts to reach a nuclear agreement between Iran and the Western (5 + 1) countries. The Russian administration continues to take control in resolving the Syrian crisis and rejecting the theory of U.S. to change the Syrian political system by using force and supporting the opposition forces with weapons. Russia has succeeded to a large extent in curbing the U.S. military force to manage the crisis in Syria that Russia in the first quarter of the 21st century has successfully and successfully restored its global role and restore the balance of international power in its favor.
One of the keys to understanding Geo-strategic Russia is to look at its location for the rest of Europe. The European peninsula is surrounded on three sides by the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea.
The easternmost part of the peninsula extends from the eastern tip of the Baltic Sea south to the Black Sea. This line also defines the eastern borders of the Baltic States—Belarus and Ukraine. These countries are the eastern edge of the European peninsula. Hardly any part of Europe is more than 400 miles from the sea and most of Europe is less than 300 miles away.
On the other hand, much of Russia is actually landlocked. The Arctic Ocean is far from the population centers of Russia, and the few existing ports cannot be used in the winter.
These geopolitical advantages were and still are elements of strength that strengthen Russia’s chances of always being a global center that allows it to adjust the rhythms and movement of international balance of power.
Cooperation between leading states and their associations are in the interests of common tasks. Of course, any logical world leaders would consider the above quote as the basis upon which international relations are built upon. But unfortunately, we have a the “Western” elite feeling the impact of their own mistakes after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, felling the impact, but remaining in denial of what has taken place mainly the fact that the Uni-polar world that they were used to exploiting is no more.
Their tactics of a modern era scorched earth applied mainly in the Middle East but without being limited there. Their tactics of installing puppet governments in other countries, close to vital security zones of their “rivals”, their offensive actions of installing nuclear capable missile launchers in an almost unretaliating distance from their same “rivals” shows that they have chosen confrontation instead of cooperation.
The confrontation, which is likely to produce results, will not be thwarted as a result of both Russia and the United States possessing nuclear weapons.
